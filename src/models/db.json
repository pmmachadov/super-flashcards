      "question": "What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript",
      "answer": "There are many ways to create objects in javascript as mentioned below:\n\n**Object literal syntax:**\n\nThe object literal syntax (or object initializer), is a comma-separated set of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.\n\n```javascript\nvar object = {\n  name: \"Sudheer\",\n  age: 34,\n};\n```\n\nObject literal property values can be of any data type, including array, function, and nested object.\n\nNote: This is one of the easiest ways to create an object and it's most commonly used for creating simple, ad-hoc objects.\n\n**Object constructor:**\n\nThe simplest way to create an empty object is using the Object constructor. Currently this approach is not recommended.\n\n```javascript\nvar object = new Object();\n```\n\nThe Object() is a built-in constructor function so \"new\" keyword is not required for creating plain objects. The above code snippet can be re-written as:\n\n```javascript\nvar object = Object();\n```\n\nHowever, Object() can be used to either create a plain object or convert a given value into its corresponding object wrapper, whereas new Object() is specifically used to explicitly create a new object instance.\n\n**Object's create method:**\n\nThe create method of Object is used to create a new object by passing the specified prototype object and properties as arguments, i.e., this pattern is helpful to create new objects based on existing objects. In other words, this is useful for setting up prototypal inheritance. The second argument is optional and it is used to create properties on a newly created object.\n\nThe following code creates a new empty object whose prototype is null.\n\n```javascript\nvar object = Object.create(null);\n```\n\nThe following example creates an object along with additional new properties.\n\n```javascript\nlet vehicle = {\n  wheels: \"4\",\n  fuelType: \"Gasoline\",\n  color: \"Green\",\n};\nlet carProps = {\n  type: {\n    value: \"Volkswagen\",\n  },\n  model: {\n    value: \"Golf\",\n  },\n};\n\nvar car = Object.create(vehicle, carProps);\nconsole.log(car);\n```\n\n**Function constructor:**\n\nIn this approach, create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances. This was the main way to do constructor-based OOP before ES6 classes.\n\n```javascript\nfunction Person(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.age = 21;\n}\nvar object = new Person(\"Sudheer\");\n```\n\n**Function constructor with prototype:**\n\nThis is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods. Using prototype means you're sharing methods/properties across instances, which saves memory and improve performance.\n\n```javascript\nfunction Person() {}\nPerson.prototype.name = \"Sudheer\";\nvar object = new Person();\n```\n\nThis is equivalent to creating an instance with Object.create method with a function prototype and then calling that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.\n\n```javascript\nfunction func(x, y, z) {\n this.x = x;\n this.y = y;\n this.z = z;\n}\n\nvar instance = new func(1, 2, 3);\n// (OR)\n\nfunction func(x, y, z) {\n   this.x = x;\n   this.y = y;\n   this.z = z;\n}\n// Create a new instance using function prototype.\nvar newInstance = Object.create(func.prototype)\n\n// Call the function\nvar result = func.call(newInstance, 1, 2, 3),\n\n// If the result is a non-null object then use it otherwise just use the new instance.\nconsole.log(result && typeof result === 'object' ? result : newInstance);\n```\n\n**Object's assign method:**\n\nThe Object.assign method is used to copy all the properties from one or more source objects and stores them into a target object. This is mainly used for cloning and merging\n\nThe following code creates a new staff object by copying properties of his working company and the car he owns.\n\n```javascript\nconst orgObject = { company: \"XYZ Corp\" };\nconst carObject = { name: \"Toyota\" };\nconst staff = Object.assign({}, orgObject, carObject);\n```\n\n**ES6 Class syntax:**\n\nES6 introduces class feature to create objects. This is syntactic sugar over the prototype-based system.\n\n```javascript\nclass Person {\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n}\n\nvar object = new Person(\"Sudheer\");\n```\n\n**Singleton pattern:**\n\nA Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance. This way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.\n\nSingleton with Closure (Classic JS Pattern)\n\n```javascript\nconst Singleton = (function () {\nlet instance;\n\nfunction createInstance() {\n  return { name: \"Sudheer\" };\n}\n\nreturn {\n  getInstance: function () {\n    if (!instance) {\n      instance = createInstance();\n    }\n    return instance;\n  }\n};\n})();\n\n// Usage\nconst obj1 = Singleton.getInstance();\nconst obj2 = Singleton.getInstance();\n\nconsole.log(obj1 === obj2); // true\n```\n\nIn modern JavaScript applications, singletons are commonly implemented using ES6 modules for their built-in caching behavior, or closures for encapsulated state management."

      "question": "What is a prototype chain",
      "answer": "The prototype chain is a core concept in JavaScript's inheritance model. It allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for it on that object itself. If it's not found, the engine looks up the object's internal [[Prototype]] reference (accessible via Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) or the deprecated __proto__ property) and continues searching up the chain until it finds the property or reaches the end (usually null).\n\nFor objects created via constructor functions, the prototype chain starts with the instance, then refers to the constructor's .prototype object, and continues from there. For example:\n\n```javascript\nfunction Person() {}\nconst person1 = new Person();\n\nconsole.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(person1) === Person.prototype); // true\n```\n\nThis mechanism allows for property and method sharing among objects, enabling code reuse and a form of inheritance.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The prototype chain enables inheritance in JavaScript.\n- If a property isn't found on an object, JavaScript looks up its prototype chain.\n- The prototype of an object instance can be accessed with Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) or __proto__.\n- The prototype of a constructor function is available via Constructor.prototype.\n- The chain ends when the prototype is null."

      "question": "What is the Difference Between call, apply, and bind",
      "answer": "In JavaScript, call, apply, and bind are methods that allow you to control the context (this value) in which a function is executed. While their purposes are similar, they differ in how they handle arguments and when the function is invoked.\n\n**call**\n\nDescription: The call() method invokes a function immediately, allowing you to specify the value of this and pass arguments individually (comma-separated).\n\nSyntax:\n```javascript\nfunc.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)\n```\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\nvar employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n\nfunction invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n  console.log(\n    greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n  );\n}\n\ninvite.call(employee1, \"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\ninvite.call(employee2, \"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n```\n\n**apply**\n\nDescription: The apply() method is similar to call(), but it takes the function arguments as an array (or array-like object) instead of individual arguments.\n\nSyntax:\n```javascript\nfunc.apply(thisArg, [argsArray])\n```\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\nvar employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n\nfunction invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n  console.log(\n    greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n  );\n}\n\ninvite.apply(employee1, [\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"]); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\ninvite.apply(employee2, [\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"]); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n```\n\n**bind**\n\nDescription: The bind() method creates a new function with a specific this value and, optionally, preset initial arguments. Unlike call and apply, bind does not immediately invoke the function; instead, it returns a new function that you can call later.\n\nSyntax:\n```javascript\nvar boundFunc = func.bind(thisArg[, arg1[, arg2[, ...]]])\n```\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\nvar employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n\nfunction invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n  console.log(\n    greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n  );\n}\n\nvar inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);\nvar inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);\n\ninviteEmployee1(\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\ninviteEmployee2(\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n```\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Method | Invokes Function Immediately? | How Arguments Are Passed | Returns |\n|--------|------------------------------|-------------------------|----------|\n| call | Yes | Comma-separated list | Function's result |\n| apply | Yes | Array or array-like object | Function's result |\n| bind | No | (Optional) preset, then rest | New function |\n\n**Key Points:**\n- call and apply are almost interchangeable; both invoke the function immediately, but differ in how arguments are passed.\n- Tip: \"Call is for Comma-separated, Apply is for Array.\"\n- bind does not execute the function immediately. Instead, it creates a new function with the specified this value and optional arguments, which can be called later.\n- Use call or apply when you want to immediately invoke a function with a specific this context. Use bind when you want to create a new function with a specific this context to be invoked later."

      "question": "What is JSON and its common operations",
      "answer": "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based data format that uses JavaScript object syntax for structuring data. It was popularized by Douglas Crockford and is widely used for transmitting data between a server and a client in web applications. JSON files typically have a .json extension and use the MIME type application/json.\n\n**Common Operations with JSON:**\n\n**1. Parsing:** Transforming a JSON-formatted string into a native JavaScript object.\n```javascript\nconst obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);\n```\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nconst jsonString = '{\"name\":\"John\",\"age\":30}';\nconst obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);  // { name: \"John\", age: 30 }\n```\n\n**2. Stringification:** Converting a JavaScript object into a JSON-formatted string, commonly used for data transmission or storage.\n```javascript\nconst jsonString = JSON.stringify(object);\n```\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nconst obj = { name: \"Jane\", age: 25 };\nconst jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj);  // '{\"name\":\"Jane\",\"age\":25}'\n```"

      "question": "What is the purpose of the array slice method",
      "answer": "The slice() method in JavaScript is used to extract a section of an array, returning a new array containing the selected elements. It does not modify the original array. The method takes two arguments:\n\n- **start:** The index at which extraction begins (inclusive).\n- **end (optional):** The index before which to end extraction (exclusive). If omitted, extraction continues to the end of the array.\n\nYou can also use negative indices, which count from the end of the array.\n\n**Examples:**\n```javascript\nlet arrayIntegers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\nlet arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegers.slice(0, 2);    // [1, 2]\nlet arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegers.slice(2, 3);    // [3]\nlet arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegers.slice(4);       // [5]\nlet arrayIntegers4 = arrayIntegers.slice(-3, -1);  // [3, 4]\n```\n\n**Note:**\nThe slice() method does not mutate (change) the original array; instead, it returns a new array containing the extracted elements."

      "question": "What is the purpose of the array splice method",
      "answer": "The splice() method in JavaScript is used to add, remove, or replace elements within an array. Unlike slice(), which creates a shallow copy and does not alter the original array, splice() modifies the original array in place and returns an array containing the removed elements.\n\n**Syntax:**\n```javascript\narray.splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...)\n```\n\n- **start:** The index at which to start changing the array.\n- **deleteCount:** (Optional) The number of elements to remove from the array. If omitted, all elements from the start index to the end of the array will be removed.\n- **item1, item2, ...:** (Optional) Elements to add to the array, starting at the start position.\n\n**Examples:**\n```javascript\nlet arrayIntegersOriginal1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nlet arrayIntegersOriginal2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nlet arrayIntegersOriginal3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\n// Remove the first two elements\nlet arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegersOriginal1.splice(0, 2); \n// arrayIntegers1: [1, 2]\n// arrayIntegersOriginal1 (after): [3, 4, 5]\n\n// Remove all elements from index 3 onwards\nlet arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegersOriginal2.splice(3);     \n// arrayIntegers2: [4, 5]\n// arrayIntegersOriginal2 (after): [1, 2, 3]\n\n// Remove 1 element at index 3, then insert \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" at that position\nlet arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegersOriginal3.splice(3, 1, \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"); \n// arrayIntegers3: [4]\n// arrayIntegersOriginal3 (after): [1, 2, 3, \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", 5]\n```\n\n**Note:**\n- The splice() method modifies the original array.\n- It returns an array containing the elements that were removed (if any).\n- You can use it both to remove and insert elements in a single operation."

      "answer": "Objects and Maps both allow you to associate keys with values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and check if a key exists. Historically, Objects have been used as Maps, but there are several key differences that make Map a better choice in certain scenarios:\n\n| Feature | Object | Map |\n|---------|---------|-----|\n| **Key Types** | Only strings and symbols are valid keys | Any value can be used as a key (objects, functions, primitives) |\n| **Key Order** | Keys are unordered (in practice, insertion order is mostly preserved for string keys, but not guaranteed) | Keys are ordered by insertion; iteration follows insertion order |\n| **Size Property** | No built-in way to get the number of keys; must use `Object.keys(obj).length` | Use the `.size` property for the number of entries |\n| **Iterability** | Not directly iterable; must use `Object.keys`, `Object.values`, or `Object.entries` | Directly iterable with `for...of`, `.keys()`, `.values()`, `.entries()` |\n| **Prototype** | Has a prototype chain; may have default properties that can collide with custom keys (can be avoided with `Object.create(null)`) | Does not have a prototype, so there are no default keys |\n| **Performance** | May be less efficient for frequent additions/removals | Optimized for frequent additions and deletions |\n| **Serialization** | Can be easily serialized to JSON | Cannot be directly serialized to JSON |"

      "question": "What is the difference between == and === operators",
      "answer": "JavaScript provides two types of equality operators:\n\n- **Loose equality (==, !=):** Performs type conversion if the types differ, comparing values after converting them to a common type.\n- **Strict equality (===, !==):** Compares both value and type, without any type conversion.\n\n**Strict Equality (===)**\n\n- Two strings are strictly equal if they have exactly the same sequence of characters and length.\n- Two numbers are strictly equal if they have the same numeric value.\n- Special cases:\n  - `NaN === NaN` is `false`\n  - `+0 === -0` is `true`\n- Two booleans are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.\n- Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same object in memory.\n- `null` and `undefined` are not strictly equal.\n\n**Loose Equality (==)**\n\n- Converts operands to the same type before making the comparison.\n- `null == undefined` is `true`.\n- `\"1\" == 1` is `true` because the string is converted to a number.\n- `0 == false` is `true` because false is converted to 0.\n\n**Examples:**\n```javascript\n0 == false            // true      (loose equality, type coercion)\n0 === false           // false     (strict equality, different types)\n1 == \"1\"              // true      (string converted to number)\n1 === \"1\"             // false     (different types)\nnull == undefined     // true      (special case)\nnull === undefined    // false     (different types)\n'0' == false          // true      ('0' is converted to 0)\n'0' === false         // false     (different types)\nNaN == NaN            // false     (NaN is never equal to itself)\nNaN === NaN           // false\n[] == []              // false     (different array objects)\n[] === []             // false\n{} == {}              // false     (different object references)\n{} === {}             // false\n```"

      "question": "What are lambda expressions or arrow functions",
      "answer": "Arrow functions (also known as \"lambda expressions\") provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions in JavaScript. Introduced in ES6, arrow functions are often shorter and more readable, especially for simple operations or callbacks.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n- Arrow functions do not have their own `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target` bindings. They inherit these from their surrounding (lexical) context.\n- They are best suited for non-method functions, such as callbacks or simple computations.\n- Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors and do not have a `prototype` property.\n- They also cannot be used with `new`, `yield`, or as generator functions.\n\n**Syntax Examples:**\n```javascript\nconst arrowFunc1 = (a, b) => a + b;    // Multiple parameters, returns a + b\nconst arrowFunc2 = a => a * 10;        // Single parameter (parentheses optional), returns a * 10\nconst arrowFunc3 = () => {};           // No parameters, returns undefined\nconst arrowFunc4 = (a, b) => {\n  // Multiple statements require curly braces and explicit return\n  const sum = a + b;\n  return sum * 2;\n};\n```"

      "answer": "In JavaScript, first-class functions (first-class citizens) mean that functions are treated like any other variable. That means:\n\n- You can assign a function to a variable.\n- You can pass a function as an argument to another function.\n- You can return a function from another function.\n\nThis capability enables powerful patterns like callbacks, higher-order functions, event handling, and functional programming in JavaScript.\n\nFor example, the handler function below is assigned to a variable and then passed as an argument to the addEventListener method.\n\n```javascript\nconst handler = () => console.log(\"This is a click handler function\");\ndocument.addEventListener(\"click\", handler);\n```"

This concept is a core part of JavaScript's functional programming capabilities and is widely used for creating modular, reusable, and expressive code.\n\nThe syntactic structure of higher order function will be explained with an example as follows:\n\n```javascript\n// First-order function (does not accept or return another function)\nconst firstOrderFunc = () => \n  console.log(\"Hello, I am a first-order function\");\n\n// Higher-order function (accepts a function as an argument)\nconst higherOrder = (callback) => callback();\n\n// Passing the first-order function to the higher-order function\nhigherOrder(firstOrderFunc);\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- `firstOrderFunc` is a regular (first-order) function.\n- `higherOrder` is a higher-order function because it takes another function as an argument.\n- `firstOrderFunc` is also called a callback function because it is passed to and executed by another function."

      "question": "What is the currying function",
      "answer": "Currying is the process of transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of nested functions, each accepting only one argument at a time.\n\nThis concept is named after mathematician Haskell Curry, and is commonly used in functional programming to enhance modularity and reuse.\n\n**Before Currying (Normal n-ary Function):**\n```javascript\nconst multiArgFunction = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;\n\nconsole.log(multiArgFunction(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 6\n```\nThis is a standard function that takes three arguments at once.\n\n**After Currying (Unary Function Chain):**\n```javascript\nconst curryUnaryFunction = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;\n\nconsole.log(curryUnaryFunction(1));       // Returns: function (b) => ...\nconsole.log(curryUnaryFunction(1)(2));    // Returns: function (c) => ...\nconsole.log(curryUnaryFunction(1)(2)(3)); // Output: 6\n```\nEach function in the chain accepts one argument and returns the next function, until all arguments are provided and the final result is computed.\n\n**Benefits of Currying:**\n\n- **Improves code reusability** → You can partially apply functions with known arguments.\n- **Enhances functional composition** → Easier to compose small, pure functions.\n- **Encourages clean, modular code** → You can split logic into smaller single-responsibility functions."

      "question": "What is a pure function",
      "answer": "A pure function is a function whose output depends only on its input arguments and produces no side effects. This means that given the same inputs, a pure function will always return the same output, and it does not modify any external state or data.\n\nLet's take an example to see the difference between pure and impure functions:\n\n**Example: Pure vs. Impure Functions**\n```javascript\n// Impure Function\nlet numberArray = [];\nconst impureAddNumber = (number) => numberArray.push(number);\n\n// Pure Function\nconst pureAddNumber = (number) => (inputArray) =>\n  inputArray.concat([number]);\n\n// Usage\nconsole.log(impureAddNumber(6)); // returns 1\nconsole.log(numberArray);        // returns [6]\n\nconsole.log(pureAddNumber(7)(numberArray)); // returns [6, 7]\nconsole.log(numberArray);                   // remains [6]\n```\n\n- `impureAddNumber` changes the external variable `numberArray` and returns the new length of the array, making it impure.\n- `pureAddNumber` creates a new array with the added number and does not modify the original array, making it pure.\n\n**Benefits of Pure Functions:**\n\n- **Easier testing:** Since output depends only on input, pure functions are simple to test.\n- **Predictability:** No hidden side effects make behavior easier to reason about.\n- **Immutability:** Pure functions align with ES6 best practices, such as preferring const over let, supporting safer and more maintainable code.\n- **No side effects:** Reduces bugs related to shared state or mutation."

      "question": "What is the purpose of the let keyword",
      "answer": "The let keyword in JavaScript is used to declare a block-scoped local variable. This means that variables declared with let are only accessible within the block, statement, or expression where they are defined. This is a significant improvement over the older var keyword, which is function-scoped (or globally-scoped if declared outside a function), and does not respect block-level scoping.\n\n**Key Features of let:**\n\n- **Block Scope:** The variable exists only within the nearest enclosing block (e.g., inside an {} pair).\n- **No Hoisting Issues:** While let declarations are hoisted, they are not initialized until the code defining them is executed. Accessing them before declaration results in a ReferenceError (temporal dead zone).\n- **No Redeclaration:** The same variable cannot be declared twice in the same scope with let.\n\n**Example:**\n```javascript\nlet counter = 30;\nif (counter === 30) {\n  let counter = 31;\n  console.log(counter); // Output: 31 (block-scoped variable inside if-block)\n}\nconsole.log(counter); // Output: 30 (outer variable, unaffected by inner block)\n```\n\nIn this example, the counter inside the if block is a separate variable from the one outside. The let keyword ensures that both have their own distinct scope.\n\nIn summary, you need to use let when you want variables to be limited to the block in which they are defined, preventing accidental overwrites and bugs related to variable scope."

      "question": "What is the reason to choose the name let as a keyword",
      "answer": "The keyword let was chosen because it originates from mathematical notation, where \"let\" is used to introduce new variables (for example, \"let x = 5\"). This term was adopted by several early programming languages such as Scheme and BASIC, establishing a tradition in computer science. JavaScript follows this convention by using let to declare variables with block scope, providing a modern alternative to var. The choice helps make the language more familiar to programmers coming from other languages and aligns with the mathematical practice of variable assignment."

      "question": "How do you redeclare variables in a switch block without an error",
      "answer": "When you try to redeclare variables using let or const in multiple case clauses of a switch statement, you will get a SyntaxError. This happens because, in JavaScript, all case clauses within a switch statement share the same block scope. For example:\n\n```javascript\nlet counter = 1;\nswitch (x) {\n  case 0:\n    let name;\n    break;\n  case 1:\n    let name; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared\n    break;\n}\n```\n\nTo avoid this error, you can create a new block scope within each case clause by wrapping the code in curly braces {}. This way, each let or const declaration is scoped only to that block, and redeclaration errors are avoided:\n\n```javascript\nlet counter = 1;\nswitch (x) {\n  case 0: {\n    let name;\n    // code for case 0\n    break;\n  }\n  case 1: {\n    let name; // No SyntaxError\n    // code for case 1\n    break;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThat means, to safely redeclare variables in different cases of a switch statement, wrap each case's code in its own block using curly braces. This ensures each variable declaration is scoped to its specific case block."

      "answer": "The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) refers to the period between the start of a block and the point where a variable declared with let or const is initialized. During this time, the variable exists in scope but cannot be accessed, and attempting to do so results in a ReferenceError.\n\nThis behavior is part of JavaScript's ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) specification and applies only to variables declared with let and const, not var. Variables declared with var are hoisted and initialized with undefined, so accessing them before the declaration does not throw an error, though it can lead to unexpected results.\n\n**Example:**\n```javascript\nfunction someMethod() {\n    console.log(counter1); // Output: undefined (due to var hoisting)\n    console.log(counter2); // Throws ReferenceError (TDZ for let)\n\n    var counter1 = 1;\n    let counter2 = 2;\n}\n```"

Each time a memoized function is called, its parameters are used to index the cache. If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function. Otherwise the function is executed and then the result is added to the cache. Let's take an example of adding function with memoization:\n\n```javascript\nconst memoizeAddition = () => {\n  let cache = {};\n  return (value) => {\n    if (value in cache) {\n      console.log(\"Fetching from cache\");\n      return cache[value]; // Here, cache.value cannot be used as property name starts with the number which is not a valid JavaScript  identifier.

Automatic Server Communication:**\\n```javascript\\n// Cookies - automatically sent with requests\\nfetch('/api/data'); // Cookies sent automatically\\n\\n// localStorage/sessionStorage - manual inclusion required\\nfetch('/api/data', {\\n  headers: {\\n    'Authorization': localStorage.getItem('token')\\n  }\\n});\\n```\\n\\n**3. Storage Capacity:**\\n```javascript\\n// Cookies - very limited (4KB total per domain)\\nconst largeData = 'x'.repeat(5000); // This would exceed cookie limit\\n\\n// localStorage/sessionStorage - much larger capacity\\nconst largeData = JSON.stringify(Array(1000).fill({\\n  id: Math.random(),\\n  data: 'large dataset'\\n})); // This works fine\\nlocalStorage.setItem('bigData', largeData);\\n```\\n\\n**4.

Persistence Duration:**\\n```javascript\\n// localStorage - persists until manually cleared\\nlocalStorage.setItem('user', 'john');\\n// Data survives: browser restart, computer restart, tab closing\\n// Only removed by: user clearing browser data, code calling clear(), or storage quota exceeded\\n\\n// sessionStorage - cleared when tab/window closes\\nsessionStorage.setItem('tempData', 'temporary');\\n// Data survives: page refresh, navigation within same tab\\n// Removed when: tab closes, window closes, browser crash\\n```\\n\\n**2. Scope and Sharing:**\\n```javascript\\n// localStorage - shared across all tabs/windows of same origin\\n// Tab 1\\nlocalStorage.setItem('sharedData', 'available everywhere');\\n\\n// Tab 2 (same domain)\\nconsole.log(localStorage.getItem('sharedData')); // 'available everywhere'\\n\\n// sessionStorage - isolated per tab/window\\n// Tab 1\\nsessionStorage.setItem('tabSpecific', 'only in this tab');\\n\\n// Tab 2 (same domain)\\nconsole.log(sessionStorage.getItem('tabSpecific')); // null\\n```\\n\\n**3.

Cross-Tab Communication:**\\n```javascript\\n// localStorage can be used for cross-tab communication\\nwindow.addEventListener('storage', function(e) {\\n  if (e.key === 'userLoggedOut') {\\n    // Log out user in all tabs\\n    window.location.href = '/login';\\n  }\\n});\\n\\n// Trigger logout in all tabs\\nfunction logoutAllTabs() {\\n  localStorage.setItem('userLoggedOut', Date.now());\\n  localStorage.removeItem('userLoggedOut'); // Clean up\\n}\\n\\n// sessionStorage cannot be used for cross-tab communication\\n// Each tab has its own isolated sessionStorage\\n```\\n\\n**5. Memory and Performance:**\\n```javascript\\n// localStorage - data stays in memory and disk\\n// Good for: long-term storage, user preferences\\n// Watch out for: storage quota limits\\n\\n// sessionStorage - typically faster access\\n// Good for: temporary data, session-specific state\\n// Automatically cleaned up when tab closes\\n```\\n\\n**Decision Matrix:**\\n\\n| Use Case | localStorage | sessionStorage |\\n|----------|--------------|----------------|\\n| User preferences | ✅ | ❌ |\\n| Authentication tokens | ✅ | ❌ |\\n| Shopping cart | ✅ | ❌ |\\n| Form backup | ❌ | ✅ |\\n| Wizard steps | ❌ | ✅ |\\n| Tab-specific state | ❌ | ✅ |\\n| Cross-tab sharing | ✅ | ❌ |\\n| Temporary caching | ❌ | ✅ |\\n| Long-term storage | ✅ | ❌ |"

      "question": "What is a regular expression",
      "answer": "A **regular expression (regex)** is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. In JavaScript, regex is used for pattern matching, searching, and replacing text within strings.\n\n**Creating Regular Expressions:**\n\n**1. Literal notation:**\n```javascript\nconst regex1 = /pattern/flags;\nconst regex2 = /hello/i; // Case-insensitive\n```\n\n**2. Constructor function:**\n```javascript\nconst regex3 = new RegExp('pattern', 'flags');\nconst regex4 = new RegExp('hello', 'i');\n```\n\n**Common Flags:**\n- `i` - Case-insensitive\n- `g` - Global (find all matches)\n- `m` - Multiline\n- `s` - Dot matches newlines\n- `u` - Unicode\n- `y` - Sticky\n\n**Basic Patterns:**\n```javascript\n// Literal characters\n/hello/          // Matches \"hello\"\n\n// Special characters\n/\\d/             // Matches any digit (0-9)\n/\\w/             // Matches any word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _)\n/\\s/             // Matches any whitespace\n/./              // Matches any character except newline\n\n// Character classes\n/[abc]/          // Matches 'a', 'b', or 'c'\n/[a-z]/          // Matches any lowercase letter\n/[^abc]/         // Matches anything except 'a', 'b', or 'c'\n\n// Quantifiers\n/a+/             // One or more 'a'\n/a*/             // Zero or more 'a'\n/a?/             // Zero or one 'a'\n/a{2,4}/         // 2 to 4 'a's\n/a{3}/           // Exactly 3 'a's\n\n// Anchors\n/^hello/         // Starts with \"hello\"\n/world$/         // Ends with \"world\"\n```\n\n**Common Methods:**\n\n**1. test() - Check if pattern exists:**\n```javascript\nconst emailRegex = /^[\\w.-]+@[\\w.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/;\nconsole.log(emailRegex.test('user@example.com')); // true\nconsole.log(emailRegex.test('invalid-email'));    // false\n```\n\n**2. match() - Find matches:**\n```javascript\nconst text = \"Call me at 123-456-7890 or 987-654-3210\";\nconst phoneRegex = /\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}/g;\nconsole.log(text.match(phoneRegex)); // [\"123-456-7890\", \"987-654-3210\"]\n```\n\n**3. replace() - Replace matches:**\n```javascript\nconst text = \"Hello World\";\nconst result = text.replace(/[aeiou]/gi, '*'); // Replace vowels\nconsole.log(result); // \"H*ll* W*rld\"\n```\n\n**4. search() - Find position:**\n```javascript\nconst text = \"JavaScript is awesome\";\nconsole.log(text.search(/script/i)); // 4 (position of \"Script\")\n```\n\n**5. split() - Split string:**\n```javascript\nconst text = \"apple,banana;orange:grape\";\nconst fruits = text.split(/[,;:]/);\nconsole.log(fruits); // [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\", \"grape\"]\n```\n\n**Practical Examples:**\n\n**Email validation:**\n```javascript\nfunction isValidEmail(email) {\n  const emailRegex = /^[^\\s@]+@[^\\s@]+\\.[^\\s@]+$/;\n  return emailRegex.test(email);\n}\n```\n\n**Extract numbers:**\n```javascript\nconst text = \"Price: $25.99, Tax: $3.50\";\nconst numbers = text.match(/\\d+\\.\\d+/g);\nconsole.log(numbers); // [\"25.99\", \"3.50\"]\n```\n\n**Format phone numbers:**\n```javascript\nfunction formatPhone(phone) {\n  const cleaned = phone.replace(/\\D/g, ''); // Remove non-digits\n  const match = cleaned.match(/^(\\d{3})(\\d{3})(\\d{4})$/);\n  if (match) {\n    return `(${match[1]}) ${match[2]}-${match[3]}`;\n  }\n  return phone;\n}\n\nconsole.log(formatPhone('1234567890')); // \"(123) 456-7890\"\n```\n\nRegular expressions are powerful tools for text processing, validation, and data extraction in JavaScript."

    {
      "id": 77,
      "question": "Why do you need a Cookie",
      "answer": "**Why Cookies Are Needed in Web Development**\n\nCookies serve essential functions in modern web applications that would otherwise be impossible due to HTTP's stateless nature. Here are the key reasons why cookies are necessary:\n\n**1. Session Management**\n\nThe most fundamental reason for cookies is maintaining user sessions across page loads:\n\n```javascript\n// Server generates a session ID when user logs in\ndocument.cookie = \"sessionId=a3fWa; max-age=3600; path=/\";\n\n// On subsequent requests, the server can identify the user\n// through this sessionId cookie sent automatically with each request\n```\n\nWithout cookies, users would need to re-authenticate on every page load or action, creating a frustrating user experience.\n\n**2. Personalization**\n\nCookies enable websites to remember user preferences and settings:\n\n```javascript\n// Store user preferences\ndocument.cookie = \"theme=dark; max-age=31536000\"; // Persist for a year\ndocument.cookie = \"fontSize=large; max-age=31536000\";\ndocument.cookie = \"region=europe; max-age=31536000\";\n\n// Later retrieve and apply these settings\nconst theme = getCookie(\"theme\");\nif (theme === \"dark\") {\n  document.body.classList.add(\"dark-mode\");\n}\n```\n\nThis personalization creates tailored experiences without requiring users to reconfigure settings on each visit.\n\n**3. Shopping Carts & E-commerce**\n\nE-commerce sites use cookies to maintain shopping cart contents across sessions:\n\n```javascript\n// Add item to cart\nfunction addToCart(productId, quantity) {\n  let cart = getCookie(\"cart\");\n  cart = cart ? JSON.parse(cart) : {};\n  \n  cart[productId] = (cart[productId] || 0) + quantity;\n  \n  document.cookie = `cart=${JSON.stringify(cart)}; path=/; max-age=86400`;\n}\n```\n\nThis allows users to add items, navigate away, and return with their selections intact.\n\n**4. Authentication State**\n\nCookies maintain authentication state securely:\n\n```javascript\n// Server sets this after successful authentication\ndocument.cookie = \"authToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict\";\n```\n\nThe HttpOnly flag prevents JavaScript access, protecting against XSS attacks, while Secure ensures transmission only over HTTPS.\n\n**5. Analytics and Tracking**\n\nCookies enable site owners to understand user behavior:\n\n```javascript\n// Set unique visitor ID\nif (!getCookie(\"visitorId\")) {\n  const uniqueId = generateUniqueId();\n  document.cookie = `visitorId=${uniqueId}; max-age=31536000`;\n}\n\n// Track page views\nfunction trackPageView() {\n  const visitorId = getCookie(\"visitorId\");\n  const page = window.location.pathname;\n  \n  // Send to analytics server\n  navigator.sendBeacon(\"/analytics\", JSON.stringify({\n    visitorId,\n    page,\n    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()\n  }));\n}\n```\n\n**6. A/B Testing**\n\nCookies are crucial for consistent A/B test experiences:\n\n```javascript\n// Assign user to test variant\nfunction assignVariant() {\n  if (!getCookie(\"testVariant\")) {\n    const variant = Math.random() > 0.5 ? \"A\" : \"B\";\n    document.cookie = `testVariant=${variant}; max-age=2592000`; // 30 days\n    return variant;\n  }\n  return getCookie(\"testVariant\");\n}\n\nconst variant = assignVariant();\nif (variant === \"B\") {\n  document.querySelector(\".hero\").style.backgroundColor = \"blue\";\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures users consistently see the same variant throughout their browsing session.\n\n**7. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**\n\nCookies help protect against CSRF attacks:\n\n```javascript\n// Server generates token and sets as cookie\ndocument.cookie = \"csrfToken=a1b2c3d4e5f6; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax\";\n\n// JavaScript retrieves token and adds to form submissions\nconst form = document.querySelector(\"form\");\nconst csrfInput = document.createElement(\"input\");\ncsrfInput.type = \"hidden\";\ncsrfInput.name = \"_csrf\";\ncsrfInput.value = getCookie(\"csrfToken\");\nform.appendChild(csrfInput);\n```\n\n**8. State Persistence in RESTful Services**\n\nRESTful APIs are stateless by design, but cookies provide a way to maintain state across requests:\n\n```javascript\n// Server sets cookies after initial API authentication\n// Subsequent API calls include these cookies automatically\nfetch('/api/user/profile', {\n  credentials: 'include' // Ensures cookies are sent\n})\n.then(response => response.json())\n.then(data => console.log(data));\n```\n\n**9. Language/Locale Preferences**\n\nRemembering language preferences improves user experience:\n\n```javascript\n// Set language preference\nfunction setLanguage(lang) {\n  document.cookie = `language=${lang}; path=/; max-age=31536000`;\n  document.documentElement.lang = lang;\n}\n\n// Apply stored language preference on page load\nconst savedLang = getCookie(\"language\") || navigator.language.split('-')[0] || \"en\";\ndocument.documentElement.lang = savedLang;\n```\n\n**10. Rate Limiting & Security**\n\nCookies help implement rate limiting and other security measures:\n\n```javascript\n// Server can track login attempts using cookies\ndocument.cookie = \"loginAttempts=1; max-age=3600\";\n\n// Increment with each failed attempt\nfunction incrementLoginAttempts() {\n  const attempts = parseInt(getCookie(\"loginAttempts\") || \"0\");\n  document.cookie = `loginAttempts=${attempts + 1}; max-age=3600`;\n  \n  // If too many attempts, lock account temporarily\n  if (attempts >= 5) {\n    document.cookie = \"accountLocked=true; max-age=1800\"; // 30 minutes\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Alternatives to Cookies:**\n\nWhile cookies are essential, they do have alternatives for specific use cases:\n\n1. **Web Storage (localStorage/sessionStorage)** - For client-side storage without automatic transmission to server\n2. **IndexedDB** - For larger structured data storage needs\n3. **JWT in Authorization headers** - For API authentication\n4. **URL parameters** - For passing temporary state (less secure)\n\nHowever, for maintaining state across HTTP requests securely and efficiently, cookies remain the most appropriate solution."

// Blocks UI thread\n\n// Better approach for large data\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  const hugeData = localStorage.getItem(\"largeDataset\");\n  processData(hugeData);\n}, 0);\n```\n\n## Advanced Usage Patterns\n\n### Storage Event Listening (localStorage)\n\n```javascript\n// This event fires in other tabs when localStorage changes\nwindow.addEventListener('storage', (event) => {\n  console.log(`Key ${event.key} changed from ${event.oldValue} to ${event.newValue}`);\n  \n  // Update UI based on the change\n  if (event.key === 'theme') {\n    applyTheme(event.newValue);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Storage Abstraction with Expiry Support\n\n```javascript\nconst storage = {\n  set(key, value, ttl = null) {\n    const item = {\n      value,\n      expiry: ttl ? Date.now() + ttl : null,\n    };\n    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(item));\n  },\n  \n  get(key) {\n    const itemStr = localStorage.getItem(key);\n    if (!itemStr) return null;\n    \n    const item = JSON.parse(itemStr);\n    if (item.expiry && Date.now() > item.expiry) {\n      localStorage.removeItem(key);\n      return null;\n    }\n    \n    return item.value;\n  }\n};\n\n// Usage\nstorage.set('user', {name: 'John'}, 3600000); // 1 hour expiry\nconst user = storage.get('user');\n```\n\n### Fallback Pattern\n\n```javascript\nfunction storeData(key, value) {\n  try {\n    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));\n  } catch (e) {\n    // localStorage might be full or disabled\n    console.warn(\"localStorage failed, falling back to cookie\", e);\n    document.cookie = `${key}=${JSON.stringify(value)};path=/;max-age=31536000`;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction getData(key) {\n  try {\n    const value = localStorage.getItem(key);\n    return value ? JSON.parse(value) : null;\n  } catch (e) {\n    // Try to get from cookie\n    const match = document.cookie.match(new RegExp(`${key}=([^;]+)`));\n    return match ? JSON.parse(match[1]) : null;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn modern web development, most applications use a combination of all three storage mechanisms for different purposes, leveraging their unique strengths while being mindful of their limitations and security implications."

      "question": "What is the difference between local storage and session storage",
      "answer": "# localStorage vs. sessionStorage\n\nBoth `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` are part of the Web Storage API, providing similar functionality with key differences in data persistence and session handling. Here's a detailed comparison:\n\n## Core Similarities\n\n**1. API and Usage Pattern**\n\nBoth storage types share identical methods and properties:\n\n```javascript\n// Basic operations (identical for both localStorage and sessionStorage)\n\n// Storing data\nstorage.setItem('key', 'value');\nstorage['key'] = 'value';  // Property access syntax\n\n// Retrieving data\nconst value = storage.getItem('key');\nconst value2 = storage['key'];  // Property access syntax\n\n// Checking if a key exists\nif (storage.getItem('key') !== null) { /* exists */ }\n\n// Removing a specific item\nstorage.removeItem('key');\ndelete storage['key'];  // Property access syntax\n\n// Clearing all data\nstorage.clear();\n\n// Getting the number of items\nconst itemCount = storage.length;\n\n// Iterating through all items\nfor (let i = 0; i < storage.length; i++) {\n  const key = storage.key(i);\n  const value = storage.getItem(key);\n  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);\n}\n\n// Using for...in loop (includes prototype properties, rarely used)\nfor (let key in storage) {\n  if (storage.hasOwnProperty(key)) {\n    console.log(`${key}: ${storage.getItem(key)}`);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**2. Storage Capacity**\n\nBoth typically offer 5-10MB of storage per origin (exact limit varies by browser).\n\n**3. Storage Scope**\n\nBoth are restricted by the same-origin policy (protocol + hostname + port).\n\n**4. Data Types**\n\nBoth can only store string values, requiring serialization for complex data types:\n\n```javascript\n// Storing objects (works the same in both storage types)\nconst user = { \n  id: 1, \n  name: \"John\",\n  preferences: {\n    theme: \"dark\",\n    fontSize: \"large\"\n  }\n};\n\n// Must serialize objects to store them\nlocalStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user));\n// or\nsessionStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user));\n\n// Retrieving and parsing\nconst retrievedUser = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'));\n// or\nconst sessionUser = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('user'));\n```\n\n## Key Differences\n\n### 1. Persistence Duration\n\n**localStorage:**\n- Data persists indefinitely until explicitly removed\n- Survives browser restarts and computer reboots\n- Only cleared by JavaScript, clearing browser data, or browser settings\n\n```javascript\n// Data stored here will persist indefinitely\nlocalStorage.setItem('userTheme', 'dark');\nlocalStorage.setItem('hasSeenTutorial', 'true');\n```\n\n**sessionStorage:**\n- Data persists only for the duration of the page session\n- Cleared when the tab/window is closed\n- Not shared between tabs (even of the same origin)\n\n```javascript\n// Data stored here will be gone when tab is closed\nsessionStorage.setItem('currentPageData', JSON.stringify(pageState));\nsessionStorage.setItem('formProgress', '3'); // e.g., step 3 of a wizard\n```\n\n### 2. Session/Tab Isolation\n\n**localStorage:**\n- Shared across all tabs and windows from the same origin\n- Changes in one tab are visible to other tabs immediately (via storage events)\n\n```javascript\n// In tab 1: Set a value\nlocalStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');\n\n// In tab 2: Can access the same value\nconsole.log(localStorage.getItem('theme')); // \"dark\"\n```\n\n**sessionStorage:**\n- Isolated to the specific tab/window where it was created\n- Each tab has its own independent sessionStorage\n- Even opening the same URL in a new tab creates a fresh sessionStorage\n\n```javascript\n// In tab 1: Set a value\nsessionStorage.setItem('currentFilter', 'newest');\n\n// In tab 2 (same URL): No access to tab 1's data\nconsole.log(sessionStorage.getItem('currentFilter')); // null\n```\n\n### 3. Window/Tab Creation Behavior\n\n**localStorage:**\n- Consistent across all contexts of the same origin\n\n**sessionStorage:**\n- New tabs created via `window.open()` inherit the sessionStorage from the opener\n- Tabs opened via Ctrl+Click or new tab/window do not inherit sessionStorage\n\n```javascript\n// In original tab\nsessionStorage.setItem('sessionData', 'important');\n\n// Open new tab programmatically\nconst newTab = window.open('same-url.html', '_blank');\n// New tab will inherit sessionStorage\n\n// But a manually opened tab will not have this data\n```\n\n### 4. Storage Events\n\n**localStorage:**\n- Changes trigger the storage event in other tabs/windows\n- Allows for cross-tab communication\n\n```javascript\n// In tab 1: Listen for changes made in other tabs\nwindow.addEventListener('storage', (event) => {\n  console.log(`Key changed: ${event.key}`);\n  console.log(`Old value: ${event.oldValue}`);\n  console.log(`New value: ${event.newValue}`);\n  console.log(`Storage area: ${event.storageArea}`);\n  console.log(`URL: ${event.url}`);\n  \n  // Update UI based on changes from other tabs\n  if (event.key === 'userLoggedIn') {\n    updateLoginStatus(event.newValue === 'true');\n  }\n});\n\n// In tab 2: Make a change that triggers the event in tab 1\nlocalStorage.setItem('userLoggedIn', 'true');\n```\n\n**sessionStorage:**\n- Changes do not trigger storage events in other contexts\n- No built-in way to communicate between tabs via sessionStorage\n\n## Use Case Scenarios\n\n### Appropriate for localStorage:\n\n**1. User Preferences**\n```javascript\nlocalStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');\nlocalStorage.setItem('fontSize', 'large');\nlocalStorage.setItem('sidebarCollapsed', 'true');\n```\n\n**2. Cached Data**\n```javascript\n// Store API responses with expiry time\nfunction cacheApiData(key, data, ttlMinutes = 60) {\n  const item = {\n    value: data,\n    expiry: Date.now() + (ttlMinutes * 60 * 1000)\n  };\n  localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(item));\n}\n\nfunction getCachedData(key) {\n  const itemStr = localStorage.getItem(key);\n  if (!itemStr) return null;\n  \n  const item = JSON.parse(itemStr);\n  if (Date.now() > item.expiry) {\n    localStorage.removeItem(key);\n    return null;\n  }\n  return item.value;\n}\n```\n\n**3. Offline Application Data**\n```javascript\n// Store data for offline use\nlocalStorage.setItem('offlineArticles', JSON.stringify(articlesData));\nlocalStorage.setItem('lastSyncTimestamp', Date.now().toString());\n```\n\n**4. Authentication Status (non-sensitive)**\n```javascript\n// Store non-sensitive auth info (actual auth should use HttpOnly cookies)\nlocalStorage.setItem('userLoggedIn', 'true');\nlocalStorage.setItem('username', 'johndoe');\nlocalStorage.setItem('lastActive', Date.now().toString());\n```\n\n### Appropriate for sessionStorage:\n\n**1. Form Data During Navigation**\n```javascript\n// Save form progress as user navigates multi-page form\nfunction saveFormProgress(step, formData) {\n  sessionStorage.setItem('formStep', step.toString());\n  sessionStorage.setItem('formData', JSON.stringify(formData));\n}\n\nfunction loadFormProgress() {\n  const step = sessionStorage.getItem('formStep') || '1';\n  const formData = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('formData') || '{}');\n  return { step: parseInt(step), formData };\n}\n```\n\n**2. Shopping Cart for Current Session**\n```javascript\nfunction addToSessionCart(productId, quantity) {\n  const cart = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('cart') || '{}');\n  cart[productId] = (cart[productId] || 0) + quantity;\n  sessionStorage.setItem('cart', JSON.stringify(cart));\n}\n```\n\n**3. Wizard/Onboarding Flow State**\n```javascript\n// Track onboarding progress within current session\nsessionStorage.setItem('onboardingStep', '2');\nsessionStorage.setItem('seenFeatures', JSON.stringify(['dashboard', 'profile']));\n```\n\n**4. Tab-Specific UI State**\n```javascript\n// Remember scroll position or UI state just for this tab\nwindow.addEventListener('scroll', () => {\n  sessionStorage.setItem('scrollPosition', window.scrollY.toString());\n});\n\n// On page load\nconst savedScroll = parseInt(sessionStorage.getItem('scrollPosition') || '0');\nif (savedScroll > 0) {\n  window.scrollTo(0, savedScroll);\n}\n```\n\n## Best Practices for Both\n\n**1. Error Handling**\n```javascript\nfunction safelyStoreData(storage, key, value) {\n  try {\n    storage.setItem(key, value);\n    return true;\n  } catch (e) {\n    // Handle QuotaExceededError or other storage errors\n    console.error('Storage failed:', e);\n    if (e.name === 'QuotaExceededError') {\n      alert('Storage full. Please clear some space.');\n      // Possibly clear older items\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**2. Type Safety**\n```javascript\nfunction storageWrapper(storage) {\n  return {\n    setObject(key, value) {\n      storage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));\n    },\n    getObject(key) {\n      try {\n        return JSON.parse(storage.getItem(key)) || null;\n      } catch (e) {\n        console.error(`Error parsing ${key}:`, e);\n        return null;\n      }\n    },\n    setNumber(key, value) {\n      storage.setItem(key, value.toString());\n    },\n    getNumber(key) {\n      return parseFloat(storage.getItem(key)) || 0;\n    },\n    setBoolean(key, value) {\n      storage.setItem(key, value ? 'true' : 'false');\n    },\n    getBoolean(key) {\n      return storage.getItem(key) === 'true';\n    }\n  };\n}\n\nconst localStore = storageWrapper(localStorage);\nconst sessionStore = storageWrapper(sessionStorage);\n\n// Usage\nlocalStore.setObject('user', {name: 'John', id: 123});\nlocalStore.setBoolean('darkMode', true);\n```\n\nIn summary, while both APIs share the same interface and capabilities, the key distinction is that `localStorage` provides persistent storage across browser sessions, while `sessionStorage` provides temporary storage limited to a single browser tab session."

      "question": "What is a promise",
      "answer": "A Promise is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It acts as a placeholder for a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved in the future.\n\nA Promise can be in one of three states:\n\n- **pending**: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.\n- **fulfilled**: The operation completed successfully.\n- **rejected**: The operation failed (e.g., due to a network error).\n\n**Promise Syntax**\n```javascript\nconst promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n  // Perform async operation\n});\n```\n\n**Example: Creating and Using a Promise**\n```javascript\nconst promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    resolve(\"I'm a Promise!\");\n  }, 5000);\n});\n\npromise\n  .then((value) => console.log(value))  // Logs after 5 seconds: \"I'm a Promise!\"\n  .catch((error) => console.error(error))  // Handles any rejection\n  .finally(() => console.log(\"Done\"));     // Runs regardless of success or failure\n```\n\nIn the above example:\n- A Promise is created to handle an asynchronous operation with resolve and reject callbacks.\n- The setTimeout resolves the promise with a value after 5 seconds.\n- `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` are used to handle success, errors, and cleanup respectively."

      "answer": "Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations, especially in languages like JavaScript, which often work with non-blocking operations such as network requests, file I/O, and timers. When an operation is asynchronous, it doesn't immediately return a result; instead, it works in the background and provides the result later. Handling this in a clean, organized way can be difficult without a structured approach.\n\nPromises are used to:\n\n- **Handle asynchronous operations.**\n- **Provide a cleaner alternative to callbacks.**\n- **Avoid callback hell.**\n- **Make code more readable and maintainable.**"

    {
      "id": 84,
      "question": "Why do we need callbacks",
      "answer": "The callbacks are needed because javascript is an event driven language. That means instead of waiting for a response, javascript will keep executing while listening for other events. Let's take an example with the first function invoking an API call(simulated by setTimeout) and the next function which logs the message.\n\n```javascript\nfunction firstFunction() {\n  // Simulate a code delay\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    console.log(\"First function called\");\n  }, 1000);\n}\nfunction secondFunction() {\n  console.log(\"Second function called\");\n}\nfirstFunction();\nsecondFunction();\n\n// Output:\n// Second function called\n// First function called\n```\n\nAs observed from the output, javascript didn't wait for the response of the first function and the remaining code block got executed.

      "question": "What is a strict mode in javascript",
      "answer": "JavaScript's \"use strict\" directive is used to opt into a stricter parsing and error-handling mode for your scripts or functions. It helps catch common bugs, makes your code more secure, and prepares it for future versions of JavaScript.\n\nStrict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a \"strict\" operating context. This way it prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. The literal expression \"use strict\"; instructs the browser to use the javascript code in the Strict mode. This also enables block-scoped variables."
    },
    {
      "id": 96,
      "question": "Why do you need strict mode",
      "answer": "Strict mode is useful to write \"secure\" JavaScript by notifying \"bad syntax\" into real errors. For example, it eliminates accidentally creating a global variable by throwing an error and also throws an error for assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object."
    },
    {
      "id": 97,
      "question": "How do you declare strict mode",
      "answer": "The strict mode is declared by adding \"use strict\"; to the beginning of a script or a function. If declared at the beginning of a script, it has global scope.\n\n```javascript\n\"use strict\";\nx = 3.14; // This will cause an error because x is not declared\n```\n\nand if you declare inside a function, it has local scope:\n\n```javascript\nx = 3.14; // This will not cause an error.\nmyFunction();\n\nfunction myFunction() {\n  \"use strict\";\n  y = 3.14; // This will cause an error\n}\n```"

Using indexOf (ES5):**\nIn an ES5 or older environment, you can use String.prototype.indexOf which returns the index of a substring. If the index value is not equal to -1 then it means the substring exists in the main string.\n\n```javascript\nvar mainString = \"hello\",\n  subString = \"hell\";\nmainString.indexOf(subString) !== -1;\n```\n\n**3. Using RegEx:**\nThe advanced solution is using Regular expression's test method(RegExp.test), which allows for testing for against regular expressions\n\n```javascript\nvar mainString = \"hello\",\n  regex = /hell/;\nregex.test(mainString);\n```"

      "question": "How do you declare a namespace",
      "answer": "Even though JavaScript lacks namespaces, we can use Objects, an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) or let/const to create namespaces.\n\n**Using Object Literal Notation:** Let's wrap variables and functions inside an Object literal which acts as a namespace. After that you can access them using object notation:\n\n```javascript\nvar namespaceOne = {\n    function func1() {\n        console.log(\"This is a first definition\");\n    }\n}\nvar namespaceTwo = {\n      function func1() {\n          console.log(\"This is a second definition\");\n      }\n  }\nnamespaceOne.func1(); // This is a first definition\nnamespaceTwo.func1(); // This is a second definition\n```\n\n**Using IIFE (Immediately invoked function expression):** The outer pair of parentheses of IIFE creates a local scope for all the code inside of it and makes the anonymous function a function expression. Due to that, you can create the same function in two different function expressions to act as a namespace:\n\n```javascript\n(function () {\n  function fun1() {\n    console.log(\"This is a first definition\");\n  }\n  fun1();\n})();\n\n(function () {\n  function fun1() {\n    console.log(\"This is a second definition\");\n  }\n  fun1();\n})();\n```\n\n**Using a block and a let/const declaration:** In ECMAScript 6, you can simply use a block and a let declaration to restrict the scope of a variable to a block:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  let myFunction = function fun1() {\n    console.log(\"This is a first definition\");\n  };\n  myFunction();\n}\n//myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.\n\n{\n  let myFunction = function fun1() {\n    console.log(\"This is a second definition\");\n  };\n  myFunction();\n}\n//myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.\n```"

      "question": "Why do you need to avoid with statement",
      "answer": "JavaScript's with statement was intended to provide a shorthand for writing recurring accesses to objects. So it can help reduce file size by reducing the need to repeat a lengthy object reference without performance penalty. Let's take an example where it is used to avoid redundancy when accessing an object several times:\n\n```javascript\na.b.c.greeting = \"welcome\";\na.b.c.age = 32;\n```\n\nUsing with it turns this into:\n\n```javascript\nwith (a.b.c) {\n  greeting = \"welcome\";\n  age = 32;\n}\n```\n\nBut this with statement creates performance problems since one cannot predict whether an argument will refer to a real variable or to a property inside the with argument."

Since the variable i is declared with the var keyword it became a global variable and the value was equal to 4 using iteration when the time setTimeout function is invoked. Hence, the output of the first loop is `4 4 4 4`.\n\nWhereas in the second loop, the variable i is declared as the let keyword it becomes a block scoped variable and it holds a new value(0, 1 ,2 3) for each iteration. Hence, the output of the second loop is `0 1 2 3`."

      "answer": "No, you cannot redeclare let and const variables. If you do, it throws below error:\n\n```\nUncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'someVariable' has already been declared\n```\n\n**Explanation:** The variable declaration with var keyword refers to a function scope and the variable is treated as if it were declared at the top of the enclosing scope due to hoisting feature. So all the multiple declarations contributing to the same hoisted variable without any error. Let's take an example of re-declaring variables in the same scope for both var and let/const variables:\n\n```javascript\nvar name = \"John\";\nfunction myFunc() {\n  var name = \"Nick\";\n  var name = \"Abraham\"; // Re-assigned in the same function block\n  alert(name); // Abraham\n}\nmyFunc();\nalert(name); // John\n```\n\nThe block-scoped multi-declaration throws syntax error:\n\n```javascript\nlet name = \"John\";\nfunction myFunc() {\n  let name = \"Nick\";\n  let name = \"Abraham\"; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared\n  alert(name);\n}\n\nmyFunc();\nalert(name);\n```"

      "question": "What is the difference between Shallow and Deep copy",
      "answer": "There are two ways to copy an object:\n\n**Shallow Copy:** Shallow copy is a bitwise copy of an object. A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object. If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.\n\n**Example:**\n```javascript\nvar empDetails = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 25,\n  expertise: \"Software Developer\",\n};\n// Create a duplicate\nvar empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails; //Shallow copying!\n// If we change some property value in the duplicate one:\nempDetailsShallowCopy.name = \"Johnson\";\n```\nThe above statement will also change the name of empDetails, since we have a shallow copy.\n\n**Deep copy:** A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.\n\n**Example:**\n```javascript\nvar empDetails = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 25,\n  expertise: \"Software Developer\",\n};\n// Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variable\nvar empDetailsDeepCopy = {\n  name: empDetails.name,\n  age: empDetails.age,\n  expertise: empDetails.expertise,\n};\n```\nNow if you change empDetailsDeepCopy.name, it will only affect empDetailsDeepCopy & not empDetails."

      "answer": "JavaScript does not have built-in support for mixins as a formal language feature. However, developers commonly implement mixins using various patterns to enable code reuse and composition.\n\nA mixin is a way to add reusable functionality from one or more objects into a class or another object, without using classical inheritance. It promotes object composition by combining behaviors or properties from different sources into a single destination.\n\n**Mixin Example using Object composition:**\n```javascript\n// Define a mixin\nconst canEat = {\n  eat() {\n    console.log(\"Eating...\");\n  }\n};\n\nconst canWalk = {\n  walk() {\n    console.log(\"Walking...\");\n  }\n};\n\nconst canRead = {\n  read() {\n    console.log(\"Reading...\");\n  }\n};\n\n// Create a class\nclass Person {\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n}\n\n// Apply mixins\nObject.assign(Person.prototype, canEat, canWalk, canRead);\n\n// Use it\nconst person = new Person(\"Sudheer\");\nperson.eat();  // Output: Eating...\nperson.walk(); // Output: Walking...\nperson.read(); // Output: Reading...\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Avoids deep inheritance hierarchies\n- Encourages composition over inheritance\n- Promotes reusable and modular code\n\nModern JavaScript favors mixin alternatives like composition, delegation, higher-order functions, and class mixins to promote reusable and modular code."

Since Arrays are truthful values, negating the arrays will produce false: ![] === false\n2. As per JavaScript coercion rules, the addition of arrays together will toString them: [] + [] === \"\"\n3. Prepend an array with + operator will convert an array to false, the negation will make it true and finally converting the result will produce value '1': +(!(+[])) === 1\n\nBy applying the above rules, we can derive below conditions:\n\n```javascript\n(![] + [] === \"false\" + !+[]) === 1;\n```\n\nNow the character pattern would be created as below:\n\n```javascript\n      s               e               l               f\n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n (![] + [])[3] + (![] + [])[4] + (![] + [])[2] + (![] + [])[0]\n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n(![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +\n(![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +\n(![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]] +\n(![] + [])[+[]]\n```"

      "answer": "Until a few days back, One shortcoming of native promises is no direct way to cancel a fetch request. But the new AbortController from js specification allows you to use a signal to abort one or multiple fetch calls. The basic flow of cancelling a fetch request would be as below:\n\n1. Create an AbortController instance\n2. Get the signal property of an instance and pass the signal as a fetch option for signal\n3. Call the AbortController's abort property to cancel all fetches that use that signal\n\nFor example, passing the same signal to multiple fetch calls will cancel all requests with that signal:\n\n```javascript\nconst controller = new AbortController();\nconst { signal } = controller;\n\nfetch(\"http://localhost:8000\", { signal })\n  .then((response) => {\n    console.log(`Request 1 is complete!`);\n  })\n  .catch((e) => {\n    if (e.name === \"AbortError\") {\n      // We know it's been canceled!\n    }\n  });\n\nfetch(\"http://localhost:8000\", { signal })\n  .then((response) => {\n    console.log(`Request 2 is complete!`);\n  })\n  .catch((e) => {\n    if (e.name === \"AbortError\") {\n      // We know it's been canceled!\n    }\n  });\n\n// Wait 2 seconds to abort both requests\nsetTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 2000);\n```"

It has two main parts:\n\n**1. SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition or Speech-to-Text):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond accordingly. This is accessed by the SpeechRecognition interface. The example below shows how to use this API to get text from speech:\n\n```javascript\nwindow.SpeechRecognition =\n  window.webkitSpeechRecognition || window.SpeechRecognition; // webkitSpeechRecognition for Chrome and SpeechRecognition for FF\nconst recognition = new window.SpeechRecognition();\nrecognition.onresult = (event) => {\n  // SpeechRecognitionEvent type\n  const speechToText = event.results[0][0].transcript;\n  console.log(speechToText);\n};\nrecognition.start();\n```\n\nIn this API, browser is going to ask you for permission to use your microphone\n\n**2. SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond. This is accessed by the SpeechSynthesis interface. For example, the below code is used to get voice/speech from text:\n\n```javascript\nif (\"speechSynthesis\" in window) {\n  var speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(\"Hello World!\");\n  speech.lang = \"en-US\";\n  window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);\n}\n```\n\nThe above examples can be tested on chrome(33+) browser's developer console.

That means even though setting a delay of 0ms will not happen instantaneously.\n\n**Browsers:** They have a minimum delay of 4ms. This throttle occurs when successive calls are triggered due to callback nesting (certain depth) or after a certain number of successive intervals. Note: The older browsers have a minimum delay of 10ms.\n\n**Nodejs:** They have a minimum delay of 1ms. This throttle happens when the delay is larger than 2147483647 or less than 1.\n\nThe best example to explain this timeout throttling behavior is the order of below code snippet:\n\n```javascript\nfunction runMeFirst() {\n  console.log(\"My script is initialized\");\n}\nsetTimeout(runMeFirst, 0);\nconsole.log(\"Script loaded\");\n```\n\nand the output would be:\n\n```\nScript loaded\nMy script is initialized\n```\n\nIf you don't use setTimeout, the order of logs will be sequential:\n\n```javascript\nfunction runMeFirst() {\n  console.log(\"My script is initialized\");\n}\nrunMeFirst();\nconsole.log(\"Script loaded\");\n```\n\nand the output is:\n\n```\nMy script is initialized\nScript loaded\n```"

Add catch block at the end of each chain:** You can add catch block to the end of each of your promise chains\n\n```javascript\nPromise.resolve(\"promised value\")\n  .then(function () {\n    throw new Error(\"error\");\n  })\n  .catch(function (error) {\n    console.error(error.stack);\n  });\n```\n\nBut it is quite difficult to type for each promise chain and verbose too.\n\n**2.

Whereas Proper tail call (PTC) is a technique where the program or code will not create additional stack frames for a recursion when the function call is a tail call.\n\nFor example, the below classic or head recursion of factorial function relies on stack for each step. Each step need to be processed upto n * factorial(n - 1):\n\n```javascript\nfunction factorial(n) {\n  if (n === 0) {\n    return 1;\n  }\n  return n * factorial(n - 1);\n}\nconsole.log(factorial(5)); //120\n```\n\nBut if you use Tail recursion functions, they keep passing all the necessary data it needs down the recursion without relying on the stack:\n\n```javascript\nfunction factorial(n, acc = 1) {\n  if (n === 0) {\n    return acc;\n  }\n  return factorial(n - 1, n * acc);\n}\nconsole.log(factorial(5)); //120\n```\n\nThe above pattern returns the same output as the first one.

      "answer": "Rest parameter collects all remaining elements into an array. Whereas Spread operator allows iterables (arrays / objects / strings) to be expanded into single arguments/elements. i.e, Rest parameter is opposite to the spread operator."

      "question": "What are the different kinds of generators",
      "answer": "There are five kinds of generators:\n\n**1. Generator function declaration:**\n\n```javascript\nfunction* myGenFunc() {\n  yield 1;\n  yield 2;\n  yield 3;\n}\nconst genObj = myGenFunc();\n```\n\n**2. Generator function expressions:**\n\n```javascript\nconst myGenFunc = function* () {\n  yield 1;\n  yield 2;\n  yield 3;\n};\nconst genObj = myGenFunc();\n```\n\n**3. Generator method definitions in object literals:**\n\n```javascript\nconst myObj = {\n  *myGeneratorMethod() {\n    yield 1;\n    yield 2;\n    yield 3;\n  },\n};\nconst genObj = myObj.myGeneratorMethod();\n```\n\n**4. Generator method definitions in class:**\n\n```javascript\nclass MyClass {\n  *myGeneratorMethod() {\n    yield 1;\n    yield 2;\n    yield 3;\n  }\n}\nconst myObject = new MyClass();\nconst genObj = myObject.myGeneratorMethod();\n```\n\n**5. Generator as a computed property:**\n\n```javascript\nconst SomeObj = {\n  *[Symbol.iterator]() {\n    yield 1;\n    yield 2;\n    yield 3;\n  },\n};\n\nconsole.log(Array.from(SomeObj)); // [ 1, 2, 3 ]\n```"
