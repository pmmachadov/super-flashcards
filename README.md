What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript
There are many ways to create objects in javascript as mentioned below:

Object literal syntax:

The object literal syntax (or object initializer), is a comma-separated set of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.

var object = {
name: "Sudheer",
age: 34,
};
Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array, function, and nested object.

Note: This is one of the easiest ways to create an object and it's most commonly used for creating simple, ad-hoc objects.

Object constructor:

The simplest way to create an empty object is using the Object constructor. Currently this approach is not recommended.

var object = new Object();
The Object() is a built-in constructor function so "new" keyword is not required for creating plain objects. The above code snippet can be re-written as:

var object = Object();
However, Object() can be used to either create a plain object or convert a given value into its corresponding object wrapper, whereas new Object() is specifically used to explicitly create a new object instance.

Object's create method:

The create method of Object is used to create a new object by passing the specified prototype object and properties as arguments, i.e., this pattern is helpful to create new objects based on existing objects. In other words, this is useful for setting up prototypal inheritance. The second argument is optional and it is used to create properties on a newly created object.

The following code creates a new empty object whose prototype is null.

var object = Object.create(null);
The following example creates an object along with additional new properties.

let vehicle = {
wheels: "4",
fuelType: "Gasoline",
color: "Green",
};
let carProps = {
type: {
value: "Volkswagen",
},
model: {
value: "Golf",
},
};

var car = Object.create(vehicle, carProps);
console.log(car);
Function constructor:

In this approach, create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances. This was the main way to do constructor-based OOP before ES6 classes.

function Person(name) {
this.name = name;
this.age = 21;
}
var object = new Person("Sudheer");
Function constructor with prototype:

This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods. Using prototype means you're sharing methods/properties across instances, which saves memory and improve performance.

function Person() {}
Person.prototype.name = "Sudheer";
var object = new Person();
This is equivalent to creating an instance with Object.create method with a function prototype and then calling that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.

function func(x, y, z) {
this.x = x;
this.y = y;
this.z = z;
}

var instance = new func(1, 2, 3);
(OR)

function func(x, y, z) {
this.x = x;
this.y = y;
this.z = z;
}
// Create a new instance using function prototype.
var newInstance = Object.create(func.prototype)

// Call the function
var result = func.call(newInstance, 1, 2, 3),

// If the result is a non-null object then use it otherwise just use the new instance.
console.log(result && typeof result === 'object' ? result : newInstance);
Object's assign method:

The Object.assign method is used to copy all the properties from one or more source objects and stores them into a target object. This is mainly used for cloning and merging

The following code creates a new staff object by copying properties of his working company and the car he owns.

const orgObject = { company: "XYZ Corp" };
const carObject = { name: "Toyota" };
const staff = Object.assign({}, orgObject, carObject);
ES6 Class syntax:

ES6 introduces class feature to create objects. This is syntactic sugar over the prototype-based system.

class Person {
constructor(name) {
this.name = name;
}
}

var object = new Person("Sudheer");
Singleton pattern:

A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance. This way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.

Singleton with Closure (Classic JS Pattern)
const Singleton = (function () {
let instance;

function createInstance() {
return { name: "Sudheer" };
}

return {
getInstance: function () {
if (!instance) {
instance = createInstance();
}
return instance;
}
};
})();

// Usage
const obj1 = Singleton.getInstance();
const obj2 = Singleton.getInstance();

console.log(obj1 === obj2); // true
In modern JavaScript applications, singletons are commonly implemented using ES6 modules for their built-in caching behavior, or closures for encapsulated state management.

What is a prototype chain
The prototype chain is a core concept in JavaScript‚Äôs inheritance model. It allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for it on that object itself. If it‚Äôs not found, the engine looks up the object's internal [[Prototype]] reference (accessible via Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) or the deprecated **proto** property) and continues searching up the chain until it finds the property or reaches the end (usually null).

For objects created via constructor functions, the prototype chain starts with the instance, then refers to the constructor‚Äôs .prototype object, and continues from there. For example:

function Person() {}
const person1 = new Person();

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(person1) === Person.prototype); // true
This mechanism allows for property and method sharing among objects, enabling code reuse and a form of inheritance.

Summary:

The prototype chain enables inheritance in JavaScript.
If a property isn‚Äôt found on an object, JavaScript looks up its prototype chain.
The prototype of an object instance can be accessed with Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) or **proto**.
The prototype of a constructor function is available via Constructor.prototype.
The chain ends when the prototype is null.
The prototype chain among objects appears as below,

What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind
The difference between Call, Apply and Bind can be explained with below examples,

Call: The call() method invokes a function with a given this value and arguments provided one by one

var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
console.log(
greeting1 +
" " +
this.firstName +
" " +
this.lastName +
", " +
greeting2
);
}

invite.call(employee1, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.call(employee2, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
Apply: Invokes the function with a given this value and allows you to pass in arguments as an array

var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
console.log(
greeting1 +
" " +
this.firstName +
" " +
this.lastName +
", " +
greeting2
);
}

invite.apply(employee1, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.apply(employee2, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
Bind: returns a new function, allowing you to pass any number of arguments

var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
console.log(
greeting1 +
" " +
this.firstName +
" " +
this.lastName +
", " +
greeting2
);
}

var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);
var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);
inviteEmployee1("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
inviteEmployee2("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
Call and Apply are pretty much interchangeable. Both execute the current function immediately. You need to decide whether it‚Äôs easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments. You can remember by treating Call is for comma (separated list) and Apply is for Array.

Bind creates a new function that will have this set to the first parameter passed to bind().

What is JSON and its common operations
JSON is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularized by Douglas Crockford. It is useful when you want to transmit data across a network. It is basically just a text file with an extension of .json, and a MIME type of application/json

Parsing: Converting a string to a native object

JSON.parse(text);
Stringification: Converting a native object to a string so that it can be transmitted across the network

JSON.stringify(object);

What is the purpose of the array slice method
The slice() method returns the selected elements in an array as a new array object. It selects the elements starting at the given start argument, and ends at the given optional end argument without including the last element. If you omit the second argument then it selects till the end of the array. This method can also accept negative index which counts back from the end of the array.

Some of the examples of this method are,

let arrayIntegers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegers.slice(0, 2); // returns [1,2]
let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegers.slice(2, 3); // returns [3]
let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegers.slice(4); //returns [5]
let arrayIntegers4 = arrayIntegers.slice(-3, -1); //returns [3, 4]
Note: Slice method doesn't mutate the original array but it returns the subset as a new array.

‚¨Ü Back to Top

What is the purpose of the array splice method
The splice() method adds/removes items to/from an array, and then returns the removed item. The first argument specifies the array position/index for insertion or deletion whereas the optional second argument indicates the number of elements to be deleted. Each additional argument is added to the array.

Some of the examples of this method are:

let arrayIntegersOriginal1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arrayIntegersOriginal2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arrayIntegersOriginal3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegersOriginal1.splice(0, 2); // returns [1, 2]; original array: [3, 4, 5]
let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegersOriginal2.splice(3); // returns [4, 5]; original array: [1, 2, 3]
let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegersOriginal3.splice(3, 1, "a", "b", "c"); //returns [4]; original array: [1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c", 5]
Note: Splice method modifies the original array and returns the deleted array.

How do you compare Object and Map
Objects are similar to Maps in that both let you set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. Due to this reason, Objects have been used as Maps historically. But there are important differences that make using a Map preferable in certain cases:

The keys of an Object can be Strings and Symbols, whereas they can be any value for a Map, including functions, objects, and any primitive type.
The keys in a Map are ordered while keys added to Object are not. Thus, when iterating over it, a Map object returns keys in the order of insertion.
You can get the size of a Map easily with the size property, while the number of properties in an Object must be determined manually.
A Map is an iterable and can thus be directly iterated, whereas iterating over an Object requires obtaining its keys in some fashion and iterating over them.
An Object has a prototype, so there are default keys in an object that could collide with your keys if you're not careful. As of ES5 this can be bypassed by creating an object(which can be called a map) using Object.create(null), but this practice is seldom done.
A Map may perform better in scenarios involving frequent addition and removal of key pairs.

What is the difference between == and === operators
JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,

Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.
Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal, i.e., having the same number value. There are two special cases in this,
NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.
Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.
Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.
Null and Undefined types are not equal with ===, but equal with == . i.e, null===undefined --> false, but null==undefined --> true
Some of the example which covers the above cases:

0 == false // true
0 === false // false
1 == "1" // true
1 === "1" // false
null == undefined // true
null === undefined // false
'0' == false // true
'0' === false // false
NaN == NaN or NaN === NaN // false
[]==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory
{}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory

What are lambda expressions or arrow functions
An arrow function is a shorter/concise syntax for a function expression and does not have its own this, arguments, super, or new.target. These functions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.

Some of the examples of arrow functions are listed as below,

const arrowFunc1 = (a, b) => a + b; // Multiple parameters
const arrowFunc2 = (a) => a \* 10; // Single parameter
const arrowFunc3 = () => {}; // no parameters

What is a first class function
In JavaScript, first-class functions(first-class citizens) mean that functions are treated like any other variable. That means:

You can assign a function to a variable.
You can pass a function as an argument to another function.
You can return a function from another function.
This capability enables powerful patterns like callbacks, higher-order functions, event handling, and functional programming in JavaScript.

For example, the handler function below is assigned to a variable and then passed as an argument to the addEventListener method.

const handler = () => console.log("This is a click handler function");
document.addEventListener("click", handler);

What is a first order function
A first-order function is a function that doesn‚Äôt accept another function as an argument and doesn‚Äôt return a function as its return value. i.e, It's a regular function that works with primitive or non-function values.

const firstOrder = () => console.log("I am a first order function!");
‚¨Ü Back to Top

What is a higher order function
A higher-order function is a function that either accepts another function as an argument, returns a function as its result, or both. This concept is a core part of JavaScript's functional programming capabilities and is widely used for creating modular, reusable, and expressive code.

The syntactic structure of higher order function will be explained with an example as follows,

// First-order function (does not accept or return another function)
const firstOrderFunc = () =>
console.log("Hello, I am a first-order function");

// Higher-order function (accepts a function as an argument)
const higherOrder = (callback) => callback();

// Passing the first-order function to the higher-order function
higherOrder(firstOrderFunc);
In this example:

firstOrderFunc is a regular (first-order) function.

higherOrder is a higher-order function because it takes another function as an argument.

firstOrderFunc is also called a callback function because it is passed to and executed by another function.

What is a unary function
A unary function (also known as a monadic function) is a function that accepts exactly one argument. The term "unary" simply refers to the function's arity‚Äîthe number of arguments it takes.

Let us take an example of unary function,

const unaryFunction = (a) => console.log(a + 10); // This will add 10 to the input and log the result
unaryFunction(5); // Output: 15
In this example:

unaryFunction takes a single parameter a, making it a unary function.
It performs a simple operation: adding 10 to the input and printing the result.

What is the currying function
Currying is the process of transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of nested functions, each accepting only one argument at a time.

This concept is named after mathematician Haskell Curry, and is commonly used in functional programming to enhance modularity and reuse.

Before Currying (Normal n-ary Function)
const multiArgFunction = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;

console.log(multiArgFunction(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 6
This is a standard function that takes three arguments at once.

After Currying (Unary Function Chain)
const curryUnaryFunction = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;

console.log(curryUnaryFunction(1)); // Returns: function (b) => ...
console.log(curryUnaryFunction(1)(2)); // Returns: function (c) => ...
console.log(curryUnaryFunction(1)(2)(3)); // Output: 6
Each function in the chain accepts one argument and returns the next function, until all arguments are provided and the final result is computed.

Benefits of Currying
Improves code reusability ‚Üí You can partially apply functions with known arguments.

Enhances functional composition ‚Üí Easier to compose small, pure functions.

Encourages clean, modular code ‚Üí You can split logic into smaller single-responsibility functions.

What is a pure function
A pure function is a function whose output depends only on its input arguments and produces no side effects. This means that given the same inputs, a pure function will always return the same output, and it does not modify any external state or data.

Let's take an example to see the difference between pure and impure functions,

Example: Pure vs. Impure Functions
// Impure Function
let numberArray = [];
const impureAddNumber = (number) => numberArray.push(number);

// Pure Function
const pureAddNumber = (number) => (inputArray) =>
inputArray.concat([number]);

// Usage
console.log(impureAddNumber(6)); // returns 1
console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]

console.log(pureAddNumber(7)(numberArray)); // returns [6, 7]
console.log(numberArray); // remains [6]
impureAddNumber changes the external variable numberArray and returns the new length of the array, making it impure.
pureAddNumber creates a new array with the added number and does not modify the original array, making it pure.
Benefits
Easier testing: Since output depends only on input, pure functions are simple to test.
Predictability: No hidden side effects make behavior easier to reason about.
Immutability: Pure functions align with ES6 best practices, such as preferring const over let, supporting safer and more maintainable code.
No side effects: Reduces bugs related to shared state or mutation.

What is the purpose of the let keyword
The let statement declares a block scope local variable. Hence the variables defined with let keyword are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. Whereas variables declared with the var keyword used to define a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.

Let's take an example to demonstrate the usage,

let counter = 30;
if (counter === 30) {
let counter = 31;
console.log(counter); // 31
}
console.log(counter); // 30 (because the variable in if block won't exist here)

What is the difference between let and var
You can list out the differences in a tabular format

var let
It has been available from the beginning of JavaScript Introduced as part of ES6
It has function scope It has block scope
Variable declaration will be hoisted, initialized as undefined Hoisted but not initialized
It is possible to re-declare the variable in the same scope It is not possible to re-declare the variable
Let's take an example to see the difference,

function userDetails(username) {
if (username) {
console.log(salary); // undefined due to hoisting
console.log(age); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization
let age = 30;
var salary = 10000;
}
console.log(salary); //10000 (accessible due to function scope)
console.log(age); //error: age is not defined(due to block scope)
}
userDetails("John");

What is the reason to choose the name let as a keyword

How do you redeclare variables in a switch block without an error
If you try to redeclare variables in a switch block then it will cause errors because there is only one block. For example, the below code block throws a syntax error as below,

let counter = 1;
switch (x) {
case 0:
let name;
break;

case 1:
let name; // SyntaxError for redeclaration.
break;
}
To avoid this error, you can create a nested block inside a case clause and create a new block scoped lexical environment.

let counter = 1;
switch (x) {
case 0: {
let name;
break;
}
case 1: {
let name; // No SyntaxError for redeclaration.
break;
}
}

What is the Temporal Dead Zone
The Temporal Dead Zone(TDZ) is a specific period or area of a block where a variable is inaccessible until it has been initialized with a value. This behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with the let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const variable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError.

Let's see this behavior with an example,

function somemethod() {
console.log(counter1); // undefined
console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError
var counter1 = 1;
let counter2 = 2;
}

What is an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. The signature of it would be as below,

(function () {
// logic here
})();
The primary reason to use an IIFE is to obtain data privacy because any variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world. i.e, If you try to access variables from the IIFE then it throws an error as below,

(function () {
var message = "IIFE";
console.log(message);
})();
console.log(message); //Error: message is not defined

How do you decode or encode a URL in JavaScript?
encodeURI() function is used to encode an URL. This function requires a URL string as a parameter and return that encoded string. decodeURI() function is used to decode an URL. This function requires an encoded URL string as parameter and return that decoded string.

Note: If you want to encode characters such as / ? : @ & = + $ # then you need to use encodeURIComponent().

let uri = "employeeDetails?name=john&occupation=manager";
let encoded_uri = encodeURI(uri);
let decoded_uri = decodeURI(encoded_uri);

What is memoization
Memoization is a functional programming technique which attempts to increase a function‚Äôs performance by caching its previously computed results. Each time a memoized function is called, its parameters are used to index the cache. If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function. Otherwise the function is executed and then the result is added to the cache. Let's take an example of adding function with memoization,

const memoizeAddition = () => {
let cache = {};
return (value) => {
if (value in cache) {
console.log("Fetching from cache");
return cache[value]; // Here, cache.value cannot be used as property name starts with the number which is not a valid JavaScript identifier. Hence, can only be accessed using the square bracket notation.
} else {
console.log("Calculating result");
let result = value + 20;
cache[value] = result;
return result;
}
};
};
// returned function from memoizeAddition
const addition = memoizeAddition();
console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 calculated
console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 cached

What is Hoisting
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables, function declarations and classes are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation. Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting,

console.log(message); //output : undefined
var message = "The variable Has been hoisted";
The above code looks like as below to the interpreter,

var message;
console.log(message);
message = "The variable Has been hoisted";
In the same fashion, function declarations are hoisted too

message("Good morning"); //Good morning

function message(name) {
console.log(name);
}
This hoisting makes functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.

What are classes in ES6
In ES6, Javascript classes are primarily syntactic sugar over JavaScript‚Äôs existing prototype-based inheritance. For example, the prototype based inheritance written in function expression as below,

function Bike(model, color) {
this.model = model;
this.color = color;
}

Bike.prototype.getDetails = function () {
return this.model + " bike has" + this.color + " color";
};
Whereas ES6 classes can be defined as an alternative

class Bike {
constructor(color, model) {
this.color = color;
this.model = model;
}

getDetails() {
return this.model + " bike has" + this.color + " color";
}
}

What are closures
A closure is the combination of a function bundled(enclosed) together with its lexical environment within which that function was declared. i.e, It is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing function‚Äôs variables, functions and other data even after the outer function has finished its execution. The closure has three scope chains.

Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets
Outer function's variables
Global variables
Let's take an example of closure concept,

function Welcome(name) {
var greetingInfo = function (message) {
console.log(message + " " + name);
};
return greetingInfo;
}
var myFunction = Welcome("John");
myFunction("Welcome "); //Output: Welcome John
myFunction("Hello Mr."); //output: Hello Mr. John
As per the above code, the inner function(i.e, greetingInfo) has access to the variables in the outer function scope(i.e, Welcome) even after the outer function has returned.

What is a service worker
A Service worker is basically a script (JavaScript file) that runs in the background, separate from a web page and provides features that don't need a web page or user interaction.

How do you reuse information across service worker restarts
The problem with service worker is that it gets terminated when not in use, and restarted when it's next needed, so you cannot rely on global state within a service worker's onfetch and onmessage handlers. In this case, service workers will have access to IndexedDB API in order to persist and reuse across restarts.

What is web storage
Web storage is an API that provides a mechanism by which browsers can store key/value pairs locally within the user's browser, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies. The web storage provides two mechanisms for storing data on the client.

What is a post message
Post message is a method that enables cross-origin communication between Window objects.(i.e, between a page and a pop-up that it spawned, or between a page and an iframe embedded within it). Generally, scripts on different pages are allowed to access each other if and only if the pages follow same-origin policy(i.e, pages share the same protocol, port number, and host).

What is a Cookie
A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your computer to be accessed by your browser. Cookies are saved as key/value pairs. For example, you can create a cookie named username as below,

document.cookie = "username=John";
Screenshot

‚¨Ü Back to Top

Why do you need a Cookie
Cookies are used to remember information about the user profile(such as username). It basically involves two steps,

When a user visits a web page, the user profile can be stored in a cookie.
Next time the user visits the page, the cookie remembers the user profile.
‚¨Ü Back to Top

What are the options in a cookie
There are few below options available for a cookie,

By default, the cookie is deleted when the browser is closed but you can change this behavior by setting expiry date (in UTC time).
document.cookie = "username=John; expires=Sat, 8 Jun 2019 12:00:00 UTC";
By default, the cookie belongs to a current page. But you can tell the browser what path the cookie belongs to using a path parameter.
document.cookie = "username=John; path=/services";
‚¨Ü Back to Top

How do you delete a cookie
You can delete a cookie by setting the expiry date as a passed date. You don't need to specify a cookie value in this case. For example, you can delete a username cookie in the current page as below.

document.cookie =
"username=; expires=Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";
Note: You should define the cookie path option to ensure that you delete the right cookie. Some browsers doesn't allow to delete a cookie unless you specify a path parameter.

What is the main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage
LocalStorage is the same as SessionStorage but it persists the data even when the browser is closed and reopened(i.e it has no expiration time) whereas in sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends.

How do you access web storage
The Window object implements the WindowLocalStorage and WindowSessionStorage objects which has localStorage(window.localStorage) and sessionStorage(window.sessionStorage) properties respectively. These properties create an instance of the Storage object, through which data items can be set, retrieved and removed for a specific domain and storage type (session or local). For example, you can read and write on local storage objects as below

localStorage.setItem("logo", document.getElementById("logo").value);
localStorage.getItem("logo");
‚¨Ü Back to Top

What are the methods available on session storage
The session storage provided methods for reading, writing and clearing the session data

// Save data to sessionStorage
sessionStorage.setItem("key", "value");

// Get saved data from sessionStorage
let data = sessionStorage.getItem("key");

// Remove saved data from sessionStorage
sessionStorage.removeItem("key");

// Remove all saved data from sessionStorage
sessionStorage.clear();

What is a storage event and its event handler
The StorageEvent is an event that fires when a storage area has been changed in the context of another document. Whereas onstorage property is an EventHandler for processing storage events. The syntax would be as below

window.onstorage = functionRef;
Let's take the example usage of onstorage event handler which logs the storage key and it's values

window.onstorage = function (e) {
console.log(
"The " +
e.key +
" key has been changed from " +
e.oldValue +
" to " +
e.newValue +
"."
);
};

Why do you need web storage
Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance. Also, the information is never transferred to the server. Hence this is a more recommended approach than Cookies.

Give an example of a web worker
You need to follow below steps to start using web workers for counting example

Create a Web Worker File: You need to write a script to increment the count value. Let's name it as counter.js
let i = 0;

function timedCount() {
i = i + 1;
postMessage(i);
setTimeout("timedCount()", 500);
}

timedCount();
Here postMessage() method is used to post a message back to the HTML page

Create a Web Worker Object: You can create a web worker object by checking for browser support. Let's name this file as web_worker_example.js
if (typeof w == "undefined") {
w = new Worker("counter.js");
}
and we can receive messages from web worker

w.onmessage = function (event) {
document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = event.data;
};
Terminate a Web Worker: Web workers will continue to listen for messages (even after the external script is finished) until it is terminated. You can use the terminate() method to terminate listening to the messages.
w.terminate();
Reuse the Web Worker: If you set the worker variable to undefined you can reuse the code
w = undefined;

What is a promise
A Promise is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It acts as a placeholder for a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved in the future.

A Promise can be in one of three states:

pending: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
fulfilled: The operation completed successfully.
rejected: The operation failed (e.g., due to a network error).
Promise Syntax
const promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
// Perform async operation
});
Example: Creating and Using a Promise
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
setTimeout(() => {
resolve("I'm a Promise!");
}, 5000);
});

promise
.then((value) => console.log(value)); // Logs after 5 seconds: "I'm a Promise!"
.catch((error) => console.error(error)) // Handles any rejection
.finally(() => console.log("Done")); // Runs regardless of success or failure
In the above example:

A Promise is created to handle an asynchronous operation with resolve and reject callbacks.
The setTimeout resolves the promise with a value after 5 seconds.
.then(), .catch(), and .finally() are used to handle success, errors, and cleanup respectively.
The action flow of a promise will be as below,

Why do you need a promise
Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations, especially in languages like JavaScript, which often work with non-blocking operations such as network requests, file I/O, and timers. When an operation is asynchronous, it doesn't immediately return a result; instead, it works in the background and provides the result later. Handling this in a clean, organized way can be difficult without a structured approach.

Promises are used to:

Handle asynchronous operations.
Provide a cleaner alternative to callbacks.
Avoid callback hell.
Make code more readable and maintainable.

Explain the three states of promise
Promises have three states:

Pending: This is an initial state of the Promise before an operation begins
Fulfilled: This state indicates that the specified operation was completed.
Rejected: This state indicates that the operation did not complete. In this case an error value will be thrown.

What is a callback function
A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an action. Let's take a simple example of how to use callback function

function callbackFunction(name) {
console.log("Hello " + name);
}

function outerFunction(callback) {
let name = prompt("Please enter your name.");
callback(name);
}

outerFunction(callbackFunction);
‚¨Ü Back to Top

Why do we need callbacks
The callbacks are needed because javascript is an event driven language. That means instead of waiting for a response, javascript will keep executing while listening for other events. Let's take an example with the first function invoking an API call(simulated by setTimeout) and the next function which logs the message.

function firstFunction() {
// Simulate a code delay
setTimeout(function () {
console.log("First function called");
}, 1000);
}
function secondFunction() {
console.log("Second function called");
}
firstFunction();
secondFunction();

// Output:
// Second function called
// First function called
As observed from the output, javascript didn't wait for the response of the first function and the remaining code block got executed. So callbacks are used in a way to make sure that certain code doesn‚Äôt execute until the other code finishes execution.

What is a callback hell
Callback Hell is an anti-pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and debug when dealing with asynchronous logic. The callback hell looks like below,

async1(function(){
async2(function(){
async3(function(){
async4(function(){
....
});
});
});
});

What are server-sent events
Server-sent events (SSE) is a server push technology enabling a browser to receive automatic updates from a server via HTTP connection without resorting to polling. These are a one way communications channel - events flow from server to client only. This has been used in Facebook/Twitter/X updates, stock price updates, news feeds etc.

‚¨Ü Back to Top

How do you receive server-sent event notifications
The EventSource object is used to receive server-sent event notifications. For example, you can receive messages from server as below,

if (typeof EventSource !== "undefined") {
var source = new EventSource("sse_generator.js");
source.onmessage = function (event) {
document.getElementById("output").innerHTML += event.data + "<br>";
};
}
‚¨Ü Back to Top

How do you check browser support for server-sent events
You can perform browser support for server-sent events before using it as below,

if (typeof EventSource !== "undefined") {
// Server-sent events supported. Let's have some code here!
} else {
// No server-sent events supported
}
‚¨Ü Back to Top

What are the events available for server sent events
Below are the list of events available for server sent events

Event Description
onopen It is used when a connection to the server is opened
onmessage This event is used when a message is received
onerror It happens when an error occurs

What are the main rules of promise
A promise must follow a specific set of rules:

A promise is an object that supplies a standard-compliant .then() method
A pending promise may transition into either fulfilled or rejected state
A fulfilled or rejected promise is settled and it must not transition into any other state.
Once a promise is settled, the value must not change.

What is callback in callback
You can nest one callback inside in another callback to execute the actions sequentially one by one. This is known as callbacks in callbacks. Beware, too many levels of nesting lead to Callback hell

loadScript("/script1.js", function (script) {
console.log("first script is loaded");

loadScript("/script2.js", function (script) {
console.log("second script is loaded");

    loadScript("/script3.js", function (script) {
      console.log("third script is loaded");
      // after all scripts are loaded
    });

});
});

What is promise chaining
The process of executing a sequence of asynchronous tasks one after another using promises is known as Promise chaining. Let's take an example of promise chaining for calculating the final result,

new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);
})
.then(function (result) {
console.log(result); // 1
return result _ 2;
})
.then(function (result) {
console.log(result); // 2
return result _ 3;
})
.then(function (result) {
console.log(result); // 6
return result \* 4;
});
In the above handlers, the result is passed to the chain of .then() handlers with the below work flow,

The initial promise resolves in 1 second,
After that .then handler is called by logging the result(1) and then return a promise with the value of result _ 2.
After that the value passed to the next .then handler by logging the result(2) and return a promise with result _ 3.
Finally the value passed to the last .then handler by logging the result(6) and return a promise with result \* 4.

What is promise.all
Promise.all is a promise that takes an array of promises as an input (an iterable), and it gets resolved when all the promises get resolved or any one of them gets rejected. For example, the syntax of promise.all method is below,

Promise.all([Promise1, Promise2, Promise3]) .then(result) => { console.log(result) }) .catch(error => console.log(`Error in promises ${error}`))
Note: Remember that the order of the promises(output the result) is maintained as per input order.

What is the purpose of the race method in promise
Promise.race() method will return the promise instance which is firstly resolved or rejected. Let's take an example of race() method where promise2 is resolved first

var promise1 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
setTimeout(resolve, 500, "one");
});
var promise2 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
setTimeout(resolve, 100, "two");
});

Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function (value) {
console.log(value); // "two" // Both promises will resolve, but promise2 is faster
});

What is a strict mode in javascript
Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a ‚Äústrict‚Äù operating context. This way it prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. The literal expression "use strict"; instructs the browser to use the javascript code in the Strict mode. This also enables block-scoped variables.

‚¨Ü Back to Top

Why do you need strict mode
Strict mode is useful to write "secure" JavaScript by notifying "bad syntax" into real errors. For example, it eliminates accidentally creating a global variable by throwing an error and also throws an error for assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object.

‚¨Ü Back to Top

How do you declare strict mode
The strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function. If declared at the beginning of a script, it has global scope.

"use strict";
x = 3.14; // This will cause an error because x is not declared
and if you declare inside a function, it has local scope

x = 3.14; // This will not cause an error.
myFunction();

function myFunction() {
"use strict";
y = 3.14; // This will cause an error
}

What is the purpose of double exclamation
The double exclamation or negation(!!) ensures the resulting type is a boolean. If it was falsey (e.g. 0, null, undefined, etc.), it will be false, otherwise, it will be true. For example, you can test IE version using this expression as below,

let isIE8 = false;
isIE8 = !!navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/);
console.log(isIE8); // returns true or false
If you don't use this expression then it returns the original value.

console.log(navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/)); // returns either an Array or null
Note: The expression !! is not an operator, but it is just twice of ! operator.

What is the purpose of the delete operator
The delete operator is used to delete the property as well as its value.

var user = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age: 20 };
delete user.age;

console.log(user); // {firstName: "John", lastName:"Doe"}
‚¨Ü Back to Top

What is typeof operator
You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable. It returns the type of a variable or an expression.

typeof "John Abraham"; // Returns "string"
typeof (1 + 2); // Returns "number"
typeof [1, 2, 3]; // Returns "object" because all arrays are also objects

What is undefined property
The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or declared but not initialized at all. The type of undefined value is undefined too.

var user; // Value is undefined, type is undefined
console.log(typeof user); //undefined
Any variable can be emptied by setting the value to undefined.

user = undefined;
‚¨Ü Back to Top

What is null value
The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values. The type of null value is object. You can empty the variable by setting the value to null.

var user = null;
console.log(typeof user); //object
‚¨Ü Back to Top

What is the difference between null and undefined
Below are the main differences between null and undefined,

Null Undefined
It is an assignment value which indicates that variable points to no object. It is not an assignment value where a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
Type of null is object Type of undefined is undefined
The null value is a primitive value that represents the null, empty, or non-existent reference. The undefined value is a primitive value used when a variable has not been assigned a value.
Indicates the absence of a value for a variable Indicates absence of variable itself
Converted to zero (0) while performing primitive operations Converted to NaN while performing primitive operations

What is the difference between window and document
Below are the main differences between window and document,

Window Document
It is the root level element in any web page It is the direct child of the window object. This is also known as Document Object Model (DOM)

window.history.forward();
}
Note: You can also access history without window prefix.

How do you detect caps lock key turned on or not
The mouseEvent getModifierState() is used to return a boolean value that indicates whether the specified modifier key is activated or not. The modifiers such as CapsLock, ScrollLock and NumLock are activated when they are clicked, and deactivated when they are clicked again.

Let's take an input element to detect the CapsLock on/off behavior with an example:

<input type="password" onmousedown="enterInput(event)" />

<p id="feedback"></p>

<script>
  function enterInput(e) {
    var flag = e.getModifierState("CapsLock");
    if (flag) {
      document.getElementById("feedback").innerHTML = "CapsLock activated";

What are the differences between undeclared and undefined variables
Below are the major differences between undeclared(not defined) and undefined variables,

undeclared undefined
These variables do not exist in a program and are not declared These variables declared in the program but have not assigned any value
If you try to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered If you try to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned.

````javascript
var a; a; // yields undefined

b; // Throws runtime error like ‚ÄûUncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined‚Äú

This can be confusing, because it says ‚Äûnot defined‚Äú instead of ‚Äûnot declared‚Äú (Chrome)

What is an event flow
Event flow is the order in which event is received on the web page. When you click an element that is nested in various other elements, before your click actually reaches its destination, or target element, it must trigger the click event for each of its parent elements first, starting at the top with the global window object.

There are two ways of event flow

Top to Bottom(Event Capturing)
Bottom to Top (Event Bubbling)
‚¨Ü Back to Top

What is event bubbling
Event bubbling is a type of event propagation where the event first triggers on the innermost target element, and then successively triggers on the ancestors (parents) of the target element in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the outermost DOM element(i.e, global window object).

By default, event handlers triggered in event bubbling phase as shown below,

<div>
  <button class="child">Hello</button>
</div>

<script>
  const parent = document.querySelector("div");
  const child = document.querySelector(".child");

  parent.addEventListener("click",
    function () {
      console.log("Parent");
    }
  );

  child.addEventListener("click", function () {

What is event capturing
Event capturing is a type of event propagation where the event is first captured by the outermost element, and then successively triggers on the descendants (children) of the target element in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the innermost target DOM element.

You can retrieve the attribute value as below, for example after typing "Good morning" into the input field:

const input = document.querySelector("input");
console.log(input.getAttribute("value")); // Good morning
console.log(input.value); // Good morning
And after you change the value of the text field to "Good evening", it becomes like

console.log(input.getAttribute("value")); // Good evening
console.log(input.value); // Good evening

What is the purpose of void 0
Void(0) is used to prevent the page from refreshing. This will be helpful to eliminate the unwanted side-effect, because it will return the undefined primitive value. It is commonly used for HTML documents that use href="JavaScript:Void(0);" within an <a> element. i.e, when you click a link, the browser loads a new page or refreshes the same page. But this behavior will be prevented using this expression. For example, the below link notify the message without reloading the page

<a href="JavaScript:void(0);" onclick="alert('Well done!')">

Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language
JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. An interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it.

How do you check whether a string contains a substring
There are 3 possible ways to check whether a string contains a substring or not,

Using includes: ES6 provided String.prototype.includes method to test a string contains a substring
var mainString = "hello",
  subString = "hell";
mainString.includes(subString);
Using indexOf: In an ES5 or older environment, you can use String.prototype.indexOf which returns the index of a substring. If the index value is not equal to -1 then it means the substring exists in the main string.
var mainString = "hello",
  subString = "hell";
mainString.indexOf(subString) !== -1;
Using RegEx: The advanced solution is using Regular expression's test method(RegExp.test), which allows for testing for against regular expressions
var mainString = "hello",
  regex = /hell/;
regex.test(mainString);

function validateEmail(email) {
  var re =
    /^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
  return re.test(String(email).toLowerCase());
}

How do you get the current url with javascript
You can use window.location.href expression to get the current url path and you can use the same expression for updating the URL too. You can also use document.URL for read-only purposes but this solution has issues in FF.

What are the various url properties of location object
The below Location object properties can be used to access URL components of the page,

href - The entire URL
protocol - The protocol of the URL
host - The hostname and port of the URL
hostname - The hostname of the URL
port - The port number in the URL
pathname - The path name of the URL

How do you check if a key exists in an object
You can check whether a key exists in an object or not using three approaches,

Using in operator: You can use the in operator whether a key exists in an object or not

"key" in obj;
and If you want to check if a key doesn't exist, remember to use parenthesis,

!("key" in obj);
Using hasOwnProperty method: You can use hasOwnProperty to particularly test for properties of the object instance (and not inherited properties)

obj.hasOwnProperty("key"); // true
Using undefined comparison: If you access a non-existing property from an object, the result is undefined. Let‚Äôs compare the properties against undefined to determine the existence of the property.

const user = {
  name: "John",
};

console.log(user.name !== undefined); // true
console.log(user.nickName !== undefined); // false

How do you loop through or enumerate javascript object
You can use the for-in loop to loop through javascript object. You can also make sure that the key you get is an actual property of an object, and doesn't come from the prototype using hasOwnProperty method.

var object = {
  k1: "value1",
  k2: "value2",
  k3: "value3",
};

for (var key in object) {
  if (object.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    console.log(key + " -> " + object[key]); // k1 -> value1 ...
  }
}

How do you test for an empty object
There are different solutions based on ECMAScript versions

Using Object entries(ECMA 7+): You can use object entries length along with constructor type.
Object.entries(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object; // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well
Using Object keys(ECMA 5+): You can use object keys length along with constructor type.
Object.keys(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object; // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well
Using for-in with hasOwnProperty(Pre-ECMA 5): You can use a for-in loop along with hasOwnProperty.
function isEmpty(obj) {
  for (var prop in obj) {
    if (obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return JSON.stringify(obj) === JSON.stringify({});

  for (var i = 0, len = arguments.length; i < len; ++i) {
    total += arguments[i];
  }
  return total;
}

sum(1, 2, 3); // returns 6
Note: You can't apply array methods on arguments object. But you can convert into a regular array as below.

var argsArray = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);

How do you trim a string in javascript
JavaScript provided a trim method on string types to trim any whitespaces present at the beginning or ending of the string.

"  Hello World   ".trim(); //Hello World
If your browser(<IE9) doesn't support this method then you can use below polyfill.

if (!String.prototype.trim) {
  (function () {
    // Make sure we trim BOM and NBSP
    var rtrim = /^[\s\uFEFF\xA0]+|[\s\uFEFF\xA0]+$/g;

How do you add a key value pair in javascript
There are two possible solutions to add new properties to an object.

Let's take a simple object to explain these solutions.

var object = {
  key1: value1,
  key2: value2,
};
Using dot notation: This solution is useful when you know the name of the property
object.key3 = "value3";
Using square bracket notation: This solution is useful when the name of the property is dynamically determined or the key's name is non-JS like "user-name"
obj["key3"] = "value3";

Is the !-- notation represents a special operator
No,that's not a special operator. But it is a combination of 2 standard operators one after the other,

How do you assign default values to variables
You can use the logical or operator || in an assignment expression to provide a default value. The syntax looks like as below,

var a = b || c;
As per the above expression, variable 'a 'will get the value of 'c' only if 'b' is falsy (if is null, false, undefined, 0, empty string, or NaN), otherwise 'a' will get the value of 'b'.

How do you define multiline strings
You can define multiline string literals using the '\n' character followed by line terminator('').

var str = "This is a \n very lengthy \n sentence!";
console.log(str);

What are break and continue statements
The break statement is used to "jump out" of a loop. i.e, It breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop.

for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) {
    break;
  }
  text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
}
The continue statement is used to "jump over" one iteration in the loop. i.e, It breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) {
    continue;
  }
  text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
}

What are js labels
The label statement allows us to name loops and blocks in JavaScript. We can then use these labels to refer back to the code later. For example, the below code with labels avoids printing the numbers when they are same,

var i, j;

loop1: for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  loop2: for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    if (i === j) {
      continue loop1;
    }
    console.log("i = " + i + ", j = " + j);
  }
}

// Output is:
//   "i = 1, j = 0"
//   "i = 2, j = 0"
//   "i = 2, j = 1"

What is tree shaking
Tree shaking is a form of dead code elimination. It means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process and for that it relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax,( i.e. import and export). Initially this has been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler rollup, these days practically all bundlers use this technique.

‚¨Ü Back to Top

What is the need of tree shaking
Tree Shaking can significantly reduce the code size in any application. i.e, The less code we send over the wire the more performant the application will be. For example, if we just want to create a ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù Application using SPA frameworks then it will take around a few MBs, but by tree shaking it can bring down the size to just a few hundred KBs. Tree shaking is implemented in Rollup and Webpack bundlers.

What is a Regular Expression
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. You can use this search pattern for searching data in a text. These can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations. Let's see the syntax format now,

/pattern/modifiers;
For example, the regular expression or search pattern with case-insensitive username would be,

/John/i;
‚¨Ü Back to Top

What are the string methods that accept Regular expression
There are six string methods: search(), replace(), replaceAll(), match(), matchAll(), and split().

The search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.

var msg = "Hello John";
var n = msg.search(/John/i); // 6
The replace() and replaceAll() methods are used to return a modified string where the pattern is replaced.

var msg = "ball bat";
var n1 = msg.replace(/b/i, "c"); // call bat
var n2 = msg.replaceAll(/b/i, "c"); // call cat
The match() and matchAll() methods are used to return the matches when matching a string against a regular expression.

var msg = "Hello John";
var n1 = msg.match(/[A-Z]/g); // ["H", "J"]
var n2 = msg.matchAll(/[A-Z]/g); // this returns an iterator
The split() method is used to split a string into an array of substrings, and returns the new array.

var msg = "Hello John";
var n = msg.split(/\s/); // ["Hello", "John"]

What are modifiers in regular expression
Modifiers can be used to perform case-insensitive and global searches. Let's list some of the modifiers,

Modifier	Description
i	Perform case-insensitive matching
g	Perform a global match rather than stops at first match
m	Perform multiline matching
Let's take an example of global modifier,

var text = "Learn JS one by one";
var pattern = /one/g;
var result = text.match(pattern); // one,one

What are regular expression patterns
Regular Expressions provide a group of patterns in order to match characters. Basically they are categorized into 3 types,

Brackets: These are used to find a range of characters. For example, below are some use cases,
[abc]: Used to find any of the characters between the brackets(a,b,c)
[0-9]: Used to find any of the digits between the brackets
(a|b): Used to find any of the alternatives separated with |
Metacharacters: These are characters with a special meaning. For example, below are some use cases,
\d: Used to find a digit
\s: Used to find a whitespace character
\b: Used to find a match at the beginning or ending of a word
Quantifiers: These are useful to define quantities. For example, below are some use cases,
n+: Used to find matches for any string that contains at least one n
n*: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
n?: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n

What would be the result of 1+2+'3'
The output is going to be 33. Since 1 and 2 are numeric values, the result of the first two digits is going to be a numeric value 3. The next digit is a string type value because of that the addition of numeric value 3 and string type value 3 is just going to be a concatenation value 33. Other operationrs like 3 * '3' do yield correct results because the string is coerced into a number.

What is the difference between proto and prototype
The __proto__ object is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve methods, etc. Whereas prototype is the object that is used to build __proto__ when you create an object with the new operator (a special variant of a function call).

new Employee().__proto__ === Employee.prototype;
new Employee().prototype === undefined;
There are few more differences,

feature	Prototype	proto
Access	All function constructors have prototype properties.	All objects have __proto__ property
Purpose	Used to reduce memory wastage with a single copy of function	Used in lookup chain to resolve methods, constructors etc.
ECMAScript	Introduced in ES6	Introduced in ES5
Usage	Frequently used	Rarely used

Can you give an example of when you really need a semicolon
It is recommended to use semicolons after every statement in JavaScript. For example, in the below case (that is an IIFE = Immediately Invoked Function Expression) it throws an error ".. is not a function" at runtime due to missing semicolon.

// define a function
var fn = (function () {
  //...
})(
  // semicolon missing at this line

  // then execute some code inside a closure
  function () {
    //...
  }
)();
and it will be interpreted as

var fn = (function () {
  //...
})(function () {
  //...
})();
In this case, we are passing the second function as an argument to the first function and then trying to call the result of the first function call as a function. Hence, the second function will fail with a "... is not a function" error at runtime.

What is the freeze method
The freeze() method is used to freeze an object. Freezing an object does not allow adding new properties to an object, prevents removing, and prevents changing the enumerability, configurability, or writability of existing properties. i.e. It returns the passed object and does not create a frozen copy.

const obj = {
  prop: 100,
};

Object.freeze(obj);
obj.prop = 200; // Throws an error in strict mode

console.log(obj.prop); //100
Remember freezing is only applied to the top-level properties in objects but not for nested objects. For example, let's try to freeze user object which has employment details as nested object and observe that details have been changed.

const user = {
  name: "John",
  employment: {
    department: "IT",
  },
};

Object.freeze(user);
user.employment.department = "HR";
Note: It causes a TypeError if the argument passed is not an object.

What is the purpose of the freeze method
Below are the main benefits of using freeze method,

It is used for freezing objects and arrays.
It is used to make an object immutable.

Why do I need to use the freeze method
In the Object-oriented paradigm, an existing API contains certain elements that are not intended to be extended, modified, or re-used outside of their current context. Hence it works as the final keyword which is used in various languages.

What are various operators supported by javascript
An operator is capable of manipulating(mathematical and logical computations) a certain value or operand. There are various operators supported by JavaScript as below,

Arithmetic Operators: Includes + (Addition), ‚Äì (Subtraction), * (Multiplication), / (Division), % (Modulus), ++ (Increment) and ‚Äì ‚Äì (Decrement)
Comparison Operators: Includes == (Equal), != (Not Equal), === (Equal with type), > (Greater than), >= (Greater than or Equal to), < (Less than), <= (Less than or Equal to)
Logical Operators: Includes && (Logical AND), || (Logical OR), ! (Logical NOT)
Assignment Operators: Includes = (Assignment Operator), += (Add and Assignment Operator), ‚Äì= (Subtract and Assignment Operator), *= (Multiply and Assignment), /= (Divide and Assignment), %= (Modules and Assignment)
Ternary Operators: It includes conditional(: ?) Operator
typeof Operator: It uses to find type of variable. The syntax looks like typeof variable

What is a rest parameter
Rest parameter is an improved way to handle function parameters which allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. The syntax would be as below,

function f(a, b, ...theArgs) {
  // ...
}
For example, let's take a sum example to calculate on dynamic number of parameters,

function sum(...args) {
  let total = 0;
  for (const i of args) {
    total += i;
  }
  return total;
}

console.log(sum(1, 2)); //3
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); //6
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); //10
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); //15
Note: Rest parameter is added in ES2015 or ES6

‚¨Ü Back to Top

What happens if you do not use rest parameter as a last argument
The rest parameter should be the last argument, as its job is to collect all the remaining arguments into an array. For example, if you define a function like below it doesn‚Äôt make any sense and will throw an error.

function someFunc(a,‚Ä¶b,c){
//You code goes here
return;

How do you determine whether object is frozen or not
Object.isFrozen() method is used to determine if an object is frozen or not.An object is frozen if all of the below conditions hold true,

If it is not extensible.
If all of its properties are non-configurable.
If all its data properties are non-writable. The usage is going to be as follows,
const object = {
  property: "Welcome JS world",
};
Object.freeze(object);
console.log(Object.isFrozen(object));

How do you determine two values same or not using object
The Object.is() method determines whether two values are the same value. For example, the usage with different types of values would be,

Object.is("hello", "hello"); // true
Object.is(window, window); // true
Object.is([], []); // false
Two values are considered identical if one of the following holds:

both undefined
both null
both true or both false
both strings of the same length with the same characters in the same order
both the same object (means both object have same reference)
both numbers and both +0 both -0 both NaN both non-zero and both not NaN and both have the same value.

How do you copy properties from one object to other
You can use the Object.assign() method which is used to copy the values and properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object which has properties and values copied from the source objects. The syntax would be as below,

Object.assign(target, ...sources);
Let's take example with one source and one target object,

const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const source = { b: 3, c: 4 };

const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

console.log(target); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }

console.log(returnedTarget); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }
As observed in the above code, there is a common property(b) from source to target so it's value has been overwritten.

What is a proxy object
The Proxy object is used to define custom behavior for fundamental operations such as property lookup, assignment, enumeration, function invocation, etc.

A proxy is created with two parameters: a target object which you want to proxy and a handler object which contains methods to intercept fundamental operations. The syntax would be as follows,

var p = new Proxy(target, handler);
Let's take a look at below examples of proxy object and how the get method which customize the lookup behavior,

//Example1:

const person = {
  name: "Sudheer Jonna",
  age: 35,
};

const handler = {
  get(target, prop) {
    if (prop === "name") {
      return "Mr. " + target[prop];
    }
    return target[prop];
  },
};

const proxy = new Proxy(person, handler);

//Example2:

var handler1 = {
  get: function (obj, prop) {
    return prop in obj ? obj[prop] : 100;
  },
};

var p = new Proxy({}, handler1);
p.a = 10;
p.b = null;

console.log(p.a, p.b); // 10, null
console.log("c" in p, p.c); // false, 100
In the above code, it uses get handler which define the behavior of the proxy when an operation is performed on it. These proxies are mainly used for some of the below cross-cutting concerns.

Logging
Authentication or Authorization
Data binding and observables
Function parameter validation
Note: This feature was introduced with ES6.

What is the purpose of the seal method
The Object.seal() method is used to seal an object, by preventing new properties from being added to it and marking all existing properties as non-configurable. But values of present properties can still be changed as long as they are writable. The next level of immutability would be the Object.freeze() method. Let's see the below example to understand more about seal() method

const object = {
  property: "Welcome JS world",
};
Object.seal(object);
object.property = "Welcome to object world";
console.log(Object.isSealed(object)); // true
delete object.property; // You cannot delete when sealed
console.log(object.property); //Welcome to object world

What are the differences between the freeze and seal methods
If an object is frozen using the Object.freeze() method then its properties become immutable and no changes can be made in them whereas if an object is sealed using the Object.seal() method then the changes can be made in the existing properties of the object.

How do you determine if an object is sealed or not
The Object.isSealed() method is used to determine if an object is sealed or not. An object is sealed if all of the below conditions hold true

If it is not extensible.
If all of its properties are non-configurable.
If it is not removable (but not necessarily non-writable). Let's see it in the action
const object = {

How do you get enumerable key and value pairs
The Object.entries() method is used to return an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, in the same order as that provided by a for...in loop. Let's see the functionality of object.entries() method in an example,

const object = {
  a: "Good morning",
  b: 100,
};

for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(object)) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`); // a: 'Good morning'
  // b: 100
}
Note: The order is not guaranteed as object defined.

How can you get the list of keys of any object
You can use the Object.keys() method which is used to return an array of a given object's own property names, in the same order as we get with a normal loop. For example, you can get the keys of a user object,

const user = {
  name: "John",
  gender: "male",
  age: 40,

const user = {
  name: "John",
  printInfo: function () {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name}.`);

What is a WeakSet
A WeakSet is used to store a collection of weakly(weak references) held objects. The syntax would be as follows,

new WeakSet([iterable]);
Let's see the below example to explain it's behavior,

var user = {};
ws.add(user);
ws.has(user); // true
ws.delete(user); // removes user from the set
ws.has(user); // false, user has been removed

What are the differences between WeakSet and Set
The main difference is that references to objects in Set are strong while references to objects in WeakSet are weak. i.e, An object in WeakSet can be garbage collected if there is no other reference to it. Other differences are:

Set can store any value whereas WeakSet can store only collections of objects
WeakSet does not have size property unlike Set
WeakSet does not have methods such as clear, keys, values, entries, forEach.

What is the Intl object
The Intl object is the namespace for the ECMAScript Internationalization API, which provides language sensitive string comparison, number formatting, and date and time formatting. It provides access to several constructors and language sensitive functions.

‚¨Ü Back to Top

How do you perform language specific date and time formatting
You can use the Intl.DateTimeFormat object which is a constructor for objects that enable language-sensitive date and time formatting. Let's see this behavior with an example,

var date = new Date(Date.UTC(2019, 07, 07, 3, 0, 0));
console.log(new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-GB").format(date)); // 07/08/2019
console.log(new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-AU").format(date)); // 07/08/2019

What is an Iterator
An iterator is an object which defines a sequence and a return value upon its termination. It implements the Iterator protocol with a next() method which returns an object with two properties: value (the next value in the sequence) and done (which is true if the last value in the sequence has been consumed).

How does synchronous iteration works
Synchronous iteration was introduced in ES6 and it works with below set of components,

Iterable: It is an object which can be iterated over via a method whose key is Symbol.iterator.

Iterator: It is an object returned by invoking [Symbol.iterator]() on an iterable. This iterator object wraps each iterated element in an object and returns it via next() method one by one.

IteratorResult: It is an object returned by next() method. The object contains two properties; the value property contains an iterated element and the done property determines whether the element is the last element or not.

Let's demonstrate synchronous iteration with an array as below

const iterable = ["one", "two", "three"];
const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'one', done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'two', done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'three', done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'undefined, done: true }

What is the event loop
The event loop is a process that continuously monitors both the call stack and the event queue and checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If the call stack is empty and there are pending events in the event queue, the event loop dequeues the event from the event queue and pushes it to the call stack. The call stack executes the event, and any additional events generated during the execution are added to the end of the event queue.

Note: The event loop allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations, even though JavaScript is single-threaded, by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible. Since most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background.

‚¨Ü Back to Top

What is the call stack
Call Stack is a data structure for javascript interpreters to keep track of function calls(creates execution context) in the program. It has two major actions,

Whenever you call a function for its execution, you are pushing it to the stack.
Whenever the execution is completed, the function is popped out of the stack.
Let's take an example and it's state representation in a diagram format

function hungry() {
  eatFruits();
}
function eatFruits() {
  return "I'm eating fruits";
}

// Invoke the `hungry` function
hungry();
The above code processed in a call stack as below,

Add the hungry() function to the call stack list and execute the code.
Add the eatFruits() function to the call stack list and execute the code.
Delete the eatFruits() function from our call stack list.
Delete the hungry() function from the call stack list since there are no items anymore.

What is the event queue
The event queue follows the queue data structure. It stores async callbacks to be added to the call stack. It is also known as the Callback Queue or Macrotask Queue.

Whenever the call stack receives an async function, it is moved into the Web API. Based on the function, Web API executes it and awaits the result. Once it is finished, it moves the callback into the event queue (the callback of a promise is moved into the microtask queue).

The event loop constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. Once the call stack is empty and there is a callback in the event queue, the event loop moves the callback into the call stack. But if there is a callback in the microtask queue as well, it is moved first. The microtask queue has a higher priority than the event queue.

What is a decorator
A decorator is an expression that evaluates to a function and that takes the target, name, and decorator descriptor as arguments. Also, it optionally returns a decorator descriptor to install on the target object. Let's define admin decorator for user class at design time,

function admin(isAdmin) {
   return function(target) {
       target.isAdmin = isAdmin;
   }
}

@admin(true)
class User() {
}
console.log(User.isAdmin); //true

 @admin(false)
 class User() {
 }
 console.log(User.isAdmin); //false

Collator: These are the objects that enable language-sensitive string comparison.
DateTimeFormat: These are the objects that enable language-sensitive date and time formatting.
ListFormat: These are the objects that enable language-sensitive list formatting.
NumberFormat: Objects that enable language-sensitive number formatting.
PluralRules: Objects that enable plural-sensitive formatting and language-specific rules for plurals.

What is an Unary operator
The unary(+) operator is used to convert a variable to a number.If the variable cannot be converted, it will still become a number but with the value NaN. Let's see this behavior in an action.

var x = "100";
var y = +x;
console.log(typeof x, typeof y); // string, number

var a = "Hello";
var b = +a;
console.log(typeof a, typeof b, b); // string, number, NaN

How do you sort elements in an array
The sort() method is used to sort the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. The default sort order is ascending, based on the string Unicode order. The example usage would be as below,

var months = ["Aug", "Sep", "Jan", "June"];
months.sort();
console.log(months); //  ["Aug", "Jan", "June", "Sep"]
Beware: sort() is changing the original array.

‚¨Ü Back to Top

What is the purpose of compareFunction while sorting arrays
The compareFunction is used to define the sort order. If omitted, the array elements are converted to strings, then sorted according to each character's Unicode code point value.

Let's take an example to see the usage of compareFunction,

let numbers = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4];
numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);
console.log(numbers); // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

How do you reverse an array
You can use the reverse() method to reverse the elements in an array. This method is useful to sort an array in descending order. Let's see the usage of reverse() method in an example,

let numbers = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4];
numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);
numbers.reverse();
console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]

How do you find the min and max values in an array
You can use Math.min and Math.max methods on array variables to find the minimum and maximum elements within an array. Let's create two functions to find the min and max value with in an array,

var marks = [50, 20, 70, 60, 45, 30];
function findMin(arr) {
  return Math.min.apply(null, arr);
}
function findMax(arr) {
  return Math.max.apply(null, arr);
}

console.log(findMin(marks));
console.log(findMax(marks));
‚¨Ü Back to Top

How do you find the min and max values without Math functions
You can write functions which loop through an array comparing each value with the lowest value or highest value to find the min and max values. Let's create those functions to find min and max values,

var marks = [50, 20, 70, 60, 45, 30];
function findMin(arr) {
  var length = arr.length;
  var min = Infinity;
  while (length--) {
    if (arr[length] < min) {
      min = arr[length];
    }
  }
  return min;
}

function findMax(arr) {
  var length = arr.length;
  var max = -Infinity;
  while (length--) {
    if (arr[length] > max) {
      max = arr[length];
    }
  }
  return max;
}

console.log(findMin(marks));
console.log(findMax(marks));

What is an empty statement and purpose of it
The empty statement is a semicolon (;) indicating that no statement will be executed, even if JavaScript syntax requires one. Since there is no action with an empty statement you might think that it's usage is quite less, but the empty statement is occasionally useful when you want to create a loop that has an empty body. For example, you can initialize an array with zero values as below,

// Initialize an array a
for (let i = 0; i < a.length; a[i++] = 0);

How do you get the metadata of a module
You can use the import.meta object which is a meta-property exposing context-specific meta data to a JavaScript module. It contains information about the current module, such as the module's URL. In browsers, you might get different meta data than NodeJS.

<script type="module" src="welcome-module.js"></script>;
console.log(import.meta); // { url: "file:///home/user/welcome-module.js" }

What is the comma operator
The comma operator is used to evaluate each of its operands from left to right and returns the value of the last operand. This is totally different from comma usage within arrays, objects, and function arguments and parameters. For example, the usage for numeric expressions would be as below,

var x = 1;
x = (x++, x);

console.log(x); // 2
‚¨Ü Back to Top

What is the advantage of the comma operator
It is normally used to include multiple expressions in a location that requires a single expression. One of the common usages of this comma operator is to supply multiple parameters in a for loop. For example, the below for loop uses multiple expressions in a single location using comma operator,

for (var a = 0, b =10; a <= 10; a++, b--)
You can also use the comma operator in a return statement where it processes before returning.

function myFunction() {
  var a = 1;
  return (a += 10), a; // 11
}

What is typescript
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft that adds optional types, classes and many other features, and compiles to plain JavaScript. Angular is built entirely in TypeScript and it is used as the primary language there. You can install it globally as

npm install -g typescript
Let's see a simple example of TypeScript usage,

function greeting(name: string): string {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}

let user = "Sudheer";

console.log(greeting(user));
The greeting method allows only string type as argument.

What are the advantages of typescript over javascript
Below are some of the advantages of typescript over javascript,

TypeScript is able to find compile time errors at the development time only and it makes sures less runtime errors. Whereas javascript is an interpreted language.
TypeScript is strongly-typed or supports static typing which allows for checking type correctness at compile time. This is not available in javascript.
TypeScript compiler can compile the .ts files into ES3,ES4 and ES5 unlike ES6 features of javascript which may not be supported in some browsers.

What is an object initializer
An object initializer is an expression that describes the initialization of an Object. The syntax for this expression is represented as a comma-delimited list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces ({}). This is also known as literal notation. It is one of the ways to create an object.

var initObject = { a: "John", b: 50, c: {} };

console.log(initObject.a); // John
‚¨Ü Back to Top

What is a constructor method
The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created within a class. If you do not specify a constructor method, a default constructor is used. The example usage of constructor would be as below,

class Employee {
  constructor() {
    this.name = "John";
  }
}

var employeeObject = new Employee();

console.log(employeeObject.name); // John
‚¨Ü Back to Top

What happens if you write constructor more than once in a class
The "constructor" in a class is a special method and it should be defined only once in a class. i.e, If you write a constructor method more than once in a class it will throw a SyntaxError error.

 class Employee {
   constructor() {
     this.name = "John";
   }
   constructor() {   //  Uncaught SyntaxError: A class may only have one constructor
     this.age = 30;
   }
 }

 var employeeObject = new Employee();

 console.log(employeeObject.name);
This constructor is called by using the special function call new (see example above).

‚¨Ü Back to Top

How do you call the constructor of a parent class
You can use the super keyword to call the constructor of a parent class. Remember that super() must be called before using this reference. Otherwise it will cause a reference error. Let's the usage of it,

class Square extends Rectangle {
  constructor(length) {
    super(length, length);
    this.name = "Square";
  }

  get area() {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }

  set area(value) {
    this.area = value;
  }
}

How do you get the prototype of an object
You can use the Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) method to return the prototype of the specified object. i.e. The value of the internal prototype property. If there are no inherited properties then null value is returned.

const newPrototype = {};
const newObject = Object.create(newPrototype);

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(newObject) === newPrototype); // true
‚¨Ü Back to Top

What happens If I pass string type for getPrototype method
In ES5, it will throw a TypeError exception if the obj parameter isn't an object. Whereas in ES2015, the parameter will be coerced to an Object.

// ES5
Object.getPrototypeOf("James"); // TypeError: "James" is not an object
// ES2015
Object.getPrototypeOf("James"); // String.prototype
‚¨Ü Back to Top

How do you set the prototype of one object to another
You can use the Object.setPrototypeOf() method that sets the prototype (i.e., the internal Prototype property) of a specified object to another object or null. For example, if you want to set prototype of a square object to rectangle object would be as follows,

Object.setPrototypeOf(Square.prototype, Rectangle.prototype);
Object.setPrototypeOf({}, null);

How do you check whether an object can be extended or not
The Object.isExtensible() method is used to determine if an object is extendable or not. i.e, Whether it can have new properties added to it or not.

const newObject = {};
console.log(Object.isExtensible(newObject)); //true
Note: By default, all the objects are extendable. i.e, The new properties can be added or modified.

‚¨Ü Back to Top

How do you prevent an object from being extend
The Object.preventExtensions() method is used to prevent new properties from ever being added to an object. In other words, it prevents future extensions to the object. Let's see the usage of this property,

const newObject = {};
Object.preventExtensions(newObject); // NOT extendable

try {
  Object.defineProperty(newObject, "newProperty", {
    // Adding new property
    value: 100,
  });
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e); // TypeError: Cannot define property newProperty, object is not extensible
}
‚¨Ü Back to Top

What are the different ways to make an object non-extensible
You can mark an object non-extensible in 3 ways,

Object.preventExtensions
Object.seal
Object.freeze
var newObject = {};

Object.preventExtensions(newObject); // Prevent objects are non-extensible
Object.isExtensible(newObject); // false

var sealedObject = Object.seal({}); // Sealed objects are non-extensible
Object.isExtensible(sealedObject); // false

var frozenObject = Object.freeze({}); // Frozen objects are non-extensible
Object.isExtensible(frozenObject); // false

How do you define multiple properties on an object
The Object.defineProperties() method is used to define new or modify existing properties directly on an object and returning the object. Let's define multiple properties on an empty object,

  newProperty1: {
    value: "John",
    writable: true,
  },
  newProperty2: {},
});

What is obfuscation in javascript
Obfuscation is the deliberate act of creating obfuscated javascript code(i.e, source or machine code) that is difficult for humans to understand. It is something similar to encryption, but a machine can understand the code and execute it. Let's see the below function before Obfuscation,

function greeting() {
  console.log("Hello, welcome to JS world");
}
And after the code Obfuscation, it would be appeared as below,

eval(
  (function (p, a, c, k, e, d) {
    e = function (c) {
      return c;
    };
    if (!"".replace(/^/, String)) {
      while (c--) {
        d[c] = k[c] || c;
      }
      k = [
        function (e) {
          return d[e];
        },
      ];
      e = function () {
        return "\\w+";
      };
      c = 1;
    }
    while (c--) {
      if (k[c]) {
        p = p.replace(new RegExp("\\b" + e(c) + "\\b", "g"), k[c]);
      }
    }
    return p;
  })(
    "2 1(){0.3('4, 7 6 5 8')}",
    9,
    9,
    "console|greeting|function|log|Hello|JS|to|welcome|world".split("|"),
    0,
    {}
  )
);

How do you perform form validation using javascript
JavaScript can be used to perform HTML form validation. For example, if the form field is empty, the function needs to notify, and return false, to prevent the form being submitted. Lets' perform user login in an html form,

<form name="myForm" onsubmit="return validateForm()" method="post">
  User name:
  <input type="text" name="uname" />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
And the validation on user login is below,

function validateForm() {
  var x = document.forms["myForm"]["uname"].value;
  if (x == "") {
    alert("The username shouldn't be empty");
    return false;
  }
}

What are the DOM methods available for constraint validation
The below DOM methods are available for constraint validation on an invalid input,

checkValidity(): It returns true if an input element contains valid data.
setCustomValidity(): It is used to set the validationMessage property of an input element. Let's take an user login form with DOM validations
function myFunction() {
  var userName = document.getElementById("uname");
  if (!userName.checkValidity()) {
    document.getElementById("message").innerHTML =

What are the validity properties
The validity property of an input element provides a set of properties related to the validity of data.

customError: It returns true, if a custom validity message is set.
patternMismatch: It returns true, if an element's value does not match its pattern attribute.
rangeOverflow: It returns true, if an element's value is greater than its max attribute.
rangeUnderflow: It returns true, if an element's value is less than its min attribute.
stepMismatch: It returns true, if an element's value is invalid according to step attribute.
tooLong: It returns true, if an element's value exceeds its maxLength attribute.
typeMismatch: It returns true, if an element's value is invalid according to type attribute.
valueMissing: It returns true, if an element with a required attribute has no value.
valid: It returns true, if an element's value is valid.

console.log(
  arrayFirst.length === arraySecond.length &&
    arrayFirst.every((value, index) => value === arraySecond[index])

What is the difference between java and javascript
Both are totally unrelated programming languages and no relation between them. Java is statically typed, compiled, runs on its own VM. Whereas Javascript is dynamically typed, interpreted, and runs in a browser and nodejs environments. Let's see the major differences in a tabular format,

Feature	Java	JavaScript
Typed	It's a strongly typed language	It's a dynamic typed language
Paradigm	Object oriented programming	Prototype based programming
Scoping	Block scoped	Function-scoped, block scoped since ES6

Does JavaScript support namespaces
JavaScript doesn‚Äôt support namespaces by default. So if you create any element (function, method, object, variable) then it becomes global and pollutes the global namespace. Let's take an example of defining two functions without any namespace,

function func1() {
  console.log("This is a first definition");
}
function func1() {
  console.log("This is a second definition");
}
func1(); // This is a second definition
It always calls the second function definition. In this case, namespaces will solve the name collision problem.

How do you declare a namespace
Even though JavaScript lacks namespaces, we can use Objects, an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) or let/const to create namespaces.

Using Object Literal Notation: Let's wrap variables and functions inside an Object literal which acts as a namespace. After that you can access them using object notation

var namespaceOne = {
    function func1() {
        console.log("This is a first definition");
    }
}
var namespaceTwo = {
      function func1() {
          console.log("This is a second definition");
      }
  }
namespaceOne.func1(); // This is a first definition
namespaceTwo.func1(); // This is a second definition
Using IIFE (Immediately invoked function expression): The outer pair of parentheses of IIFE creates a local scope for all the code inside of it and makes the anonymous function a function expression. Due to that, you can create the same function in two different function expressions to act as a namespace.

(function () {
  function fun1() {
    console.log("This is a first definition");
  }
  fun1();
})();

(function () {
  function fun1() {
    console.log("This is a second definition");
  }
  fun1();
})();
Using a block and a let/const declaration: In ECMAScript 6, you can simply use a block and a let declaration to restrict the scope of a variable to a block.

{
  let myFunction = function fun1() {
    console.log("This is a first definition");
  };
  myFunction();
}
//myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.

{
  let myFunction = function fun1() {
    console.log("This is a second definition");
  };
  myFunction();
}
//myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.

jQuery is a popular cross-browser JavaScript library that provides Document Object Model (DOM) traversal, event handling, animations and AJAX interactions by minimizing the discrepancies across browsers. It is widely famous with its philosophy of ‚ÄúWrite less, do more‚Äù. For example, you can display welcome message on the page load using jQuery as below,

$(document).ready(function () {
  // It selects the document and apply the function on page load
  alert("Welcome to jQuery world");
});
Note: You can download it from jquery's official site or install it from CDNs, like google.

Why do we call javascript as dynamic language
JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language because variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned/reassigned with values of all types.

let age = 50; // age is a number now
age = "old"; // age is a string now
age = true; // age is a boolean

void expression;
Let's display a message without any redirection or reload

<a href="javascript:void(alert('Welcome to JS world'))">
  Click here to see a message
</a>
Note: This operator is often used to obtain the undefined primitive value, using void(0). Also it can be used to call asynchronous functions without waiting for the result.

Why do you need to avoid with statement
JavaScript's with statement was intended to provide a shorthand for writing recurring accesses to objects. So it can help reduce file size by reducing the need to repeat a lengthy object reference without performance penalty. Let's take an example where it is used to avoid redundancy when accessing an object several times.

a.b.c.greeting = "welcome";
a.b.c.age = 32;
Using with it turns this into:

with (a.b.c) {
  greeting = "welcome";
  age = 32;
}
But this with statement creates performance problems since one cannot predict whether an argument will refer to a real variable or to a property inside the with argument.

What is the output of the following for loops
for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
  // global scope
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i));
}

for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
  // block scope
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i));
}
The output of the above for loops is 4 4 4 4 and 0 1 2 3

Explanation: Due to the event queue/loop of javascript, the setTimeout callback function is called after the loop has been executed. Since the variable i is declared with the var keyword it became a global variable and the value was equal to 4 using iteration when the time setTimeout function is invoked. Hence, the output of the second loop is 4 4 4 4.

Whereas in the second loop, the variable i is declared as the let keyword it becomes a block scoped variable and it holds a new value(0, 1 ,2 3) for each iteration. Hence, the output of the first loop is 0 1 2 3.

What is ES6
ES6 is the sixth edition of the javascript language and it was released in June 2015. It was initially known as ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and later renamed to ECMAScript 2015. Almost all the modern browsers support ES6 but for the old browsers there are many transpilers, like Babel.js etc.

Can I redeclare let and const variables
No, you cannot redeclare let and const variables. If you do, it throws below error

Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'someVariable' has already been declared
Explanation: The variable declaration with var keyword refers to a function scope and the variable is treated as if it were declared at the top of the enclosing scope due to hoisting feature. So all the multiple declarations contributing to the same hoisted variable without any error. Let's take an example of re-declaring variables in the same scope for both var and let/const variables.

var name = "John";
function myFunc() {
  var name = "Nick";
  var name = "Abraham"; // Re-assigned in the same function block
  alert(name); // Abraham
}
myFunc();
alert(name); // John
The block-scoped multi-declaration throws syntax error,

let name = "John";
function myFunc() {
  let name = "Nick";
  let name = "Abraham"; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared
  alert(name);
}

myFunc();
alert(name);

Does the const variable make the value immutable
No, the const variable doesn't make the value immutable. But it disallows subsequent assignments(i.e, You can declare with assignment but can't assign another value later)

const userList = [];
userList.push("John"); // Can mutate even though it can't re-assign
console.log(userList); // ['John']

What are default parameters
In ES5, we need to depend on logical OR operators to handle default values of function parameters. Whereas in ES6, Default function parameters feature allows parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed. Let's compare the behavior with an examples,

//ES5
var calculateArea = function (height, width) {
  height = height || 50;
  width = width || 60;

  return width * height;
};
console.log(calculateArea()); //300
The default parameters makes the initialization more simpler,

//ES6
var calculateArea = function (height = 50, width = 60) {
  return width * height;
};

console.log(calculateArea()); //300

What are template literals
Template literals or template strings are string literals allowing embedded expressions. These are enclosed by the back-tick (`) character instead of double or single quotes. In ES6, this feature enables using dynamic expressions as below,

var greeting = `Welcome to JS World, Mr. ${firstName} ${lastName}.`;
In ES5, you need break string like below,

var greeting = 'Welcome to JS World, Mr. ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName.`
Note: You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with template literals.

‚¨Ü Back to Top

How do you write multi-line strings in template literals
In ES5, you would have to use newline escape characters('\n') and concatenation symbols(+) in order to get multi-line strings.

console.log("This is string sentence 1\n" + "This is string sentence 2");
Whereas in ES6, You don't need to mention any newline sequence character,

console.log(`This is string sentence
'This is string sentence 2`);

What are nesting templates
The nesting template is a feature supported within template literals syntax to allow inner backticks inside a placeholder ${ } within the template. For example, the below nesting template is used to display the icons based on user permissions whereas outer template checks for platform type,

const iconStyles = `icon ${
  isMobilePlatform()
    ? ""
    : `icon-${user.isAuthorized ? "submit" : "disabled"}`
}`;
You can write the above use case without nesting template features as well. However, the nesting template feature is more compact and readable.

//Without nesting templates
const iconStyles = `icon ${
  isMobilePlatform()
    ? ""
    : user.isAuthorized
    ? "icon-submit"
    : "icon-disabled"
}`;

What are tagged templates
Tagged templates are the advanced form of templates in which tags allow you to parse template literals with a function. The tag function accepts the first parameter as an array of strings and remaining parameters as expressions. This function can also return manipulated strings based on parameters. Let's see the usage of this tagged template behavior of an IT professional skill set in an organization,

var user1 = "John";
var skill1 = "JavaScript";
var experience1 = 15;

var user2 = "Kane";
var skill2 = "JavaScript";
var experience2 = 5;

function myInfoTag(strings, userExp, experienceExp, skillExp) {
  var str0 = strings[0]; // "Mr/Ms. "
  var str1 = strings[1]; // " is a/an "
  var str2 = strings[2]; // "in"

  var expertiseStr;
  if (experienceExp > 10) {
    expertiseStr = "expert developer";
  } else if (skillExp > 5 && skillExp <= 10) {
    expertiseStr = "senior developer";
  } else {
    expertiseStr = "junior developer";
  }

  return `${str0}${userExp}${str1}${expertiseStr}${str2}${skillExp}`;
}

var output1 = myInfoTag`Mr/Ms. ${user1} is a/an ${experience1} in ${skill1}`;
var output2 = myInfoTag`Mr/Ms. ${user2} is a/an ${experience2} in ${skill2}`;

console.log(output1); // Mr/Ms. John is a/an expert developer in JavaScript
console.log(output2); // Mr/Ms. Kane is a/an junior developer in JavaScript

What are raw strings
ES6 provides a raw strings feature using the String.raw() method which is used to get the raw string form of template strings. This feature allows you to access the raw strings as they were entered, without processing escape sequences. For example, the usage would be as below,

var calculationString = String.raw`The sum of numbers is \n${
  1 + 2 + 3 + 4
}!`;
console.log(calculationString); // The sum of numbers is \n10!
If you don't use raw strings, the newline character sequence will be processed by displaying the output in multiple lines

var calculationString = `The sum of numbers is \n${1 + 2 + 3 + 4}!`;
console.log(calculationString);
// The sum of numbers is
// 10!
Also, the raw property is available on the first argument to the tag function

function tag(strings) {
  console.log(strings.raw[0]);
}

What is destructuring assignment
The destructuring assignment is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables. Let's get the month values from an array using destructuring assignment

var [one, two, three] = ["JAN", "FEB", "MARCH"];

console.log(one); // "JAN"
console.log(two); // "FEB"
console.log(three); // "MARCH"
and you can get user properties of an object using destructuring assignment,

var { name, age } = { name: "John", age: 32 };

console.log(name); // John
console.log(age); // 32
‚¨Ü Back to Top

What are default values in destructuring assignment
A variable can be assigned a default value when the value unpacked from the array or object is undefined during destructuring assignment. It helps to avoid setting default values separately for each assignment. Let's take an example for both arrays and object use cases,

Arrays destructuring:

var x, y, z;

[x = 2, y = 4, z = 6] = [10];
console.log(x); // 10
console.log(y); // 4
console.log(z); // 6
Objects destructuring:

var { x = 2, y = 4, z = 6 } = { x: 10 };

console.log(x); // 10
console.log(y); // 4
console.log(z); // 6

How do you swap variables in destructuring assignment
If you don't use destructuring assignment, swapping two values requires a temporary variable. Whereas using a destructuring feature, two variable values can be swapped in one destructuring expression. Let's swap two number variables in array destructuring assignment,

var x = 10,
  y = 20;

[x, y] = [y, x];
console.log(x); // 20
console.log(y); // 10

What are enhanced object literals
Object literals make it easy to quickly create objects with properties inside the curly braces. For example, it provides shorter syntax for common object property definition as below.

//ES6
var x = 10,
  y = 20;
obj = { x, y };
console.log(obj); // {x: 10, y:20}
//ES5
var x = 10,
  y = 20;
obj = { x: x, y: y };
console.log(obj); // {x: 10, y:20}

What are dynamic imports
The dynamic imports using import() function syntax allows us to load modules on demand by using promises or the async/await syntax. Currently this feature is in stage4 proposal. The main advantage of dynamic imports is reduction of our bundle's sizes, the size/payload response of our requests and overall improvements in the user experience. The syntax of dynamic imports would be as below,

import("./Module").then((Module) => Module.method());

if (isLegacyBrowser()) {
    import(¬∑¬∑¬∑)
    .then(¬∑¬∑¬∑);
}

Typed arrays are array-like objects from ECMAScript 6 API for handling binary data. JavaScript provides 12 Typed array types,

Int8Array: An array of 8-bit signed integers
Uint8Array: An array of 8-bit unsigned integers
Uint8ClampedArray: An array of 8-bit unsigned integers clamped to 0-255
Int16Array: An array of 16-bit signed integers
Uint16Array: An array of 16-bit unsigned integers
Int32Array: An array of 32-bit signed integers
Uint32Array: An array of 32-bit unsigned integers
BigInt64Array: An array of 64-bit signed BigInts
BigUint64Array: An array of 64-bit unsigned BigInts
Float16Array: An array of 16-bit floating point numbers
Float32Array: An array of 32-bit floating point numbers
Float64Array: An array of 64-bit floating point numbers
For example, you can create an array of 8-bit signed integers as below

const a = new Int8Array();
// You can pre-allocate n bytes
const bytes = 1024;
const a = new Int8Array(bytes);

console.log(l10nDE.compare("√§", "z") === -1); // true
console.log(l10nSV.compare("√§", "z") === +1); // true
Sorting:
var list = ["√§", "a", "z"]; // In German,  "√§" sorts with "a" Whereas in Swedish, "√§" sorts after "z"
var l10nDE = new Intl.Collator("de");
var l10nSV = new Intl.Collator("sv");

Is PostMessage secure

What are the problems with postmessage target origin as wildcard
The second argument of postMessage method specifies which origin is allowed to receive the message. If you use the wildcard ‚Äú*‚Äù as an argument then any origin is allowed to receive the message. In this case, there is no way for the sender window to know if the target window is at the target origin when sending the message. If the target window has been navigated to another origin, the other origin would receive the data. Hence, this may lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

targetWindow.postMessage(message, "*");

How do you avoid receiving postMessages from attackers
Since the listener listens for any message, an attacker can trick the application by sending a message from the attacker‚Äôs origin, which gives an impression that the receiver received the message from the actual sender‚Äôs window. You can avoid this issue by validating the origin of the message on the receiver's end using the ‚Äúmessage.origin‚Äù attribute.

For example, let's check the sender's origin http://www.some-sender.com on receiver side www.some-receiver.com,

//Listener on http://www.some-receiver.com/
window.addEventListener("message", function(message){
    if(/^http://www\.some-sender\.com$/.test(message.origin)){
         console.log('You received the data from valid sender', message.data);
   }
});

You can throw EvalError with in try...catch block as below,

try {
  throw new EvalError('Eval function error', 'someFile.js', 100);

Parameter is the variable name of a function definition whereas an argument represents the value given to a function when it is invoked. Let's explain this with a simple function

function myFunction(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  console.log(arguments[0]); // "argument1"
  console.log(arguments[1]); // "argument2"
  console.log(arguments[2]); // "argument3"
}
myFunction("argument1", "argument2", "argument3");

What is the purpose of some method in arrays
The some() method is used to test whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. The method returns a boolean value. Let's take an example to test for any odd elements,

var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

var odd = (element) => element % 2 !== 0;

console.log(array.some(odd)); // true (the odd element exists)

How do you combine two or more arrays
The concat() method is used to join two or more arrays by returning a new array containing all the elements. The syntax would be as below,

array1.concat(array2, array3, ..., arrayX)
Let's take an example of array's concatenation with veggies and fruits arrays,

var veggies = ["Tomato", "Carrot", "Cabbage"];
var fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pears"];
var veggiesAndFruits = veggies.concat(fruits);
console.log(veggiesAndFruits); // Tomato, Carrot, Cabbage, Apple, Orange, Pears

What is the difference between Shallow and Deep copy
There are two ways to copy an object,

Shallow Copy: Shallow copy is a bitwise copy of an object. A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object. If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.

Example

var empDetails = {
  name: "John",
  age: 25,
  expertise: "Software Developer",
};
to create a duplicate

var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails; //Shallow copying!
if we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:

empDetailsShallowCopy.name = "Johnson";
The above statement will also change the name of empDetails, since we have a shallow copy. That means we're losing the original data as well.

Deep copy: A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.

Example

var empDetails = {
  name: "John",
  age: 25,
  expertise: "Software Developer",
};
Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variable

var empDetailsDeepCopy = {
  name: empDetails.name,
  age: empDetails.age,
  expertise: empDetails.expertise,
};
Now if you change empDetailsDeepCopy.name, it will only affect empDetailsDeepCopy & not empDetails

How do you create specific number of copies of a string
The repeat() method is used to construct and return a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together. Remember that this method has been added to the ECMAScript 2015 specification. Let's take an example of Hello string to repeat it 4 times,

"Hello".repeat(4); // 'HelloHelloHelloHello'
How do you return all matching strings against a regular expression
The matchAll() method can be used to return an iterator of all results matching a string against a regular expression. For example, the below example returns an array of matching string results against a regular expression,

let regexp = /Hello(\d?)/g;
let greeting = "Hello1Hello2Hello3";

let greetingList = [...greeting.matchAll(regexp)];

console.log(greetingList[0][0]); //Hello1
console.log(greetingList[1][0]); //Hello2
console.log(greetingList[2][0]); //Hello3

How do you trim a string at the beginning or ending
The trim method of string prototype is used to trim on both sides of a string. But if you want to trim especially at the beginning or ending of the string then you can use trimStart/trimLeft and trimEnd/trimRight methods. Let's see an example of these methods on a greeting message,

var greeting = "   Hello, Goodmorning!   ";

console.log(greeting); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!   "
console.log(greeting.trimStart()); // "Hello, Goodmorning!   "
console.log(greeting.trimLeft()); // "Hello, Goodmorning!   "

console.log(greeting.trimEnd()); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!"
console.log(greeting.trimRight()); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!"

What is the output of below console statement with unary operator
Let's take console statement with unary operator as given below,

console.log(+"Hello"); // NaN
The output of the above console log statement returns NaN. Because the element is prefixed by the unary operator and the JavaScript interpreter will try to convert that element into a number type. Since the conversion fails, the value of the statement results in NaN value.

Does javascript uses mixins
JavaScript does not have built-in support for mixins as a formal language feature. However, developers commonly implement mixins using various patterns to enable code reuse and composition.

A mixin is a way to add reusable functionality from one or more objects into a class or another object, without using classical inheritance. It promotes object composition by combining behaviors or properties from different sources into a single destination.

Mixin Example using Object composition
// Define a mixin
const canEat = {
  eat() {
    console.log("Eating...");
  }
};

const canWalk = {
  walk() {
    console.log("Walking...");
  }
};

const canRead = {
  read() {
    console.log("Reading...");
  }
};

// Create a class
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

// Apply mixins
Object.assign(Person.prototype, canEat, canWalk, canRead);

// Use it
const person = new Person("Sudheer");
person.eat();  // Output: Eating...
person.walk(); // Output: Walking...
person.read(); // Output: Reading...
Benefits
Avoids deep inheritance hierarchies
Encourages composition over inheritance
Promotes reusable and modular code
Modern JavaScript favors mixin alternatives like composition, delegation, higher-order functions, and class mixins to promote reusable and modular code. Libraries like Lodash offer utilities for object composition, while frameworks like Vue.js provide built-in mixin features to promote reusable and modular code.

What is a thunk function
A thunk is just a function which delays the evaluation of the value. It doesn‚Äôt take any arguments but gives the value whenever you invoke the thunk. i.e, It is used not to execute now but it will be sometime in the future. Let's take a synchronous example,

const add = (x, y) => x + y;

const thunk = () => add(2, 3);

thunk(); // 5

What are asynchronous thunks
The asynchronous thunks are useful to make network requests. Let's see an example of network requests,

function fetchData(fn) {
  fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((json) => fn(json));
}

const asyncThunk = function () {
  return fetchData(function getData(data) {
    console.log(data);
  });
};

asyncThunk();
The getData function won't be called immediately but it will be invoked only when the data is available from API endpoint. The setTimeout function is also used to make our code asynchronous. The best real time example is redux state management library which uses the asynchronous thunks to delay the actions to dispatch.

What is the output of below function calls
Code snippet:

const circle = {
  radius: 20,
  diameter() {
    return this.radius * 2;
  },
  perimeter: () => 2 * Math.PI * this.radius,
};
console.log(circle.diameter());
console.log(circle.perimeter());
Output:

The output is 40 and NaN. Remember that diameter is a regular function, whereas the value of perimeter is an arrow function. The this keyword of a regular function(i.e, diameter) refers to the surrounding scope which is a class(i.e, Shape object). Whereas this keyword of perimeter function refers to the surrounding scope which is a window object. Since there is no radius property on window objects it returns an undefined value and the multiple of number value returns NaN value.

How to remove all line breaks from a string
The easiest approach is using regular expressions to detect and replace newlines in the string. In this case, we use replace function along with string to replace with, which in our case is an empty string.

function remove_linebreaks( var message ) {
    return message.replace( /[\r\n]+/gm, "" );
}
In the above expression, g and m are for global and multiline flags.

What is the difference between reflow and repaint
A repaint occurs when changes are made which affect the visibility of an element, but not its layout. Examples of this include outline, visibility, or background color. A reflow involves changes that affect the layout of a portion of the page (or the whole page). Resizing the browser window, changing the font, content changing (such as user typing text), using JavaScript methods involving computed styles, adding or removing elements from the DOM, and changing an element's classes are a few of the things that can trigger reflow. Reflow of an element causes the subsequent reflow of all child and ancestor elements as well as any elements following it in the DOM.

How do you create self string using special characters
The self string can be formed with the combination of []()!+ characters. You need to remember the below conventions to achieve this pattern.

Since Arrays are truthful values, negating the arrays will produce false: ![] === false
As per JavaScript coercion rules, the addition of arrays together will toString them: [] + [] === ""
Prepend an array with + operator will convert an array to false, the negation will make it true and finally converting the result will produce value '1': +(!(+[])) === 1
By applying the above rules, we can derive below conditions

(![] + [] === "false" + !+[]) === 1;
Now the character pattern would be created as below,

      s               e               l               f
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

const flattenArr = [].concat(...biDimensionalArr); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]
But you can make it work with multi-dimensional arrays by recursive calls,

function flattenMultiArray(arr) {
  const flattened = [].concat(...arr);
  return flattened.some((item) => Array.isArray(item))
    ? flattenMultiArray(flattened)

const flatArr = flattenMultiArray(multiDimensionalArr); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]
Also you can use the flat method of Array.

const arr = [1, [2, 3], 4, 5, [6, 7]];
const fllattenArr = arr.flat(); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

How do you capture browser back button
The beforeunload event is triggered when the window, the document and its resources are about to be unloaded. This event is helpful to warn users about losing the current data and detect back button event.

window.addEventListener("beforeunload", () => {
  console.log("Clicked browser back button");
});
You can also use popstate event to detect the browser back button. Note: The history entry has been activated using history.pushState method.

window.addEventListener("popstate", () => {
  console.log("Clicked browser back button");
  box.style.backgroundColor = "white";
});

const box = document.getElementById("div");

box.addEventListener("click", () => {
  box.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
  window.history.pushState({}, null, null);
});
In the preceeding code, When the box element clicked, its background color appears in blue color and changed to while color upon clicking the browser back button using `popstate` event handler. The `state` property of `popstate` contains the copy of history entry's state object.

How to cancel a fetch request
Until a few days back, One shortcoming of native promises is no direct way to cancel a fetch request. But the new AbortController from js specification allows you to use a signal to abort one or multiple fetch calls. The basic flow of cancelling a fetch request would be as below,

Create an AbortController instance
Get the signal property of an instance and pass the signal as a fetch option for signal
Call the AbortController's abort property to cancel all fetches that use that signal For example, passing the same signal to multiple fetch calls will cancel all requests with that signal,
const controller = new AbortController();
const { signal } = controller;

fetch("http://localhost:8000", { signal })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(`Request 1 is complete!`);
  })
  .catch((e) => {
    if (e.name === "AbortError") {
      // We know it's been canceled!
    }
  });

fetch("http://localhost:8000", { signal })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(`Request 2 is complete!`);
  })
  .catch((e) => {
    if (e.name === "AbortError") {
      // We know it's been canceled!

What is web speech API
Web speech API is used to enable modern browsers recognize and synthesize speech(i.e, voice data into web apps). This API was introduced by W3C Community in the year 2012. It has two main parts:

SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition or Speech-to-Text): It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond accordingly. This is accessed by the SpeechRecognition interface. The example below shows how to use this API to get text from speech,
window.SpeechRecognition =
  window.webkitSpeechRecognition || window.SpeechRecognition; // webkitSpeechRecognition for Chrome and SpeechRecognition for FF
const recognition = new window.SpeechRecognition();
recognition.onresult = (event) => {
  // SpeechRecognitionEvent type
  const speechToText = event.results[0][0].transcript;
  console.log(speechToText);
};
recognition.start();
In this API, browser is going to ask you for permission to use your microphone

SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech): It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond. This is accessed by the SpeechSynthesis interface. For example, the below code is used to get voice/speech from text,
if ("speechSynthesis" in window) {
  var speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("Hello World!");
  speech.lang = "en-US";
  window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);
}
The above examples can be tested on chrome(33+) browser's developer console. Note: This API is still a working draft and only available in Chrome and Firefox browsers(ofcourse Chrome only implemented the specification)

What is minimum timeout throttling
Both browser and NodeJS javascript environments throttles with a minimum delay that is greater than 0ms. That means even though setting a delay of 0ms will not happen instantaneously. Browsers: They have a minimum delay of 4ms. This throttle occurs when successive calls are triggered due to callback nesting(certain depth) or after a certain number of successive intervals. Note: The older browsers have a minimum delay of 10ms. Nodejs: They have a minimum delay of 1ms. This throttle happens when the delay is larger than 2147483647 or less than 1. The best example to explain this timeout throttling behavior is the order of below code snippet.

function runMeFirst() {
  console.log("My script is initialized");
}
setTimeout(runMeFirst, 0);
console.log("Script loaded");
and the output would be in

Script loaded
My script is initialized
If you don't use setTimeout, the order of logs will be sequential.

function runMeFirst() {
  console.log("My script is initialized");
}
runMeFirst();
console.log("Script loaded");
and the output is,

My script is initialized

A task is any javascript code/program which is scheduled to be run by the standard mechanisms such as initially starting to run a program, run an event callback, or an interval or timeout being fired. All these tasks are scheduled on a task queue. Below are the list of use cases to add tasks to the task queue,

When a new javascript program is executed directly from console or running by the <script> element, the task will be added to the task queue.

What is microtask
A microtask is a type of JavaScript callback that is scheduled to run immediately after the currently executing script and before the next event loop tick. Microtasks are executed after the current task completes and before any new tasks (macrotasks) are run. This ensures a fast and predictable update cycle.

Common sources of microtasks stored in the microtask queue include:

Promises: When a Promise is resolved or rejected, its .then(), .catch(), and .finally() callbacks are placed in the microtask queue.

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
 console.log('Microtask from a Promise');
});
queueMicrotask():

A method that explicitly schedules a function to be run in the microtask queue.

 queueMicrotask(() => {
    console.log('Microtask from  queueMicrotask');
  });
MutationObserver callbacks:

Observers changes in the DOM and triggers a callback as a microtask.

   const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
     console.log('Microtask from MutationObserver');
   })
   observer.observe(document.body, {childList: true});
await:
Await internally uses Promises, so the code after await is scheduled as a microtask.

 async function asyncFunction() {
   await null;
   console.log('Microtask from Await'); // Schedule this code as microtask
 }
Note: All of these microtasks are processed in the same turn of the event loop.

The purpose of queueMicrotask is to ensure that a function is executed after the current task has finished, but before the browser performs any rendering or handles user events.

Example:

console.log("Start"); //1

queueMicrotask(() => {
  console.log("Inside microtask"); // 3
});

console.log("End"); //2
By using queueMicrotask, you can ensure that certain tasks or callbacks are executed at the earliest opportunity during the JavaScript event loop, making it useful for performing work that needs to be done asynchronously but with higher priority than regular setTimeout or setInterval callbacks.

How do you use javascript libraries in typescript file
It is known that not all JavaScript libraries or frameworks have TypeScript declaration files. But if you still want to use libraries or frameworks in your TypeScript files without getting compilation errors, the only solution is declare keyword along with a variable declaration. For example, let's imagine you have a library called customLibrary that doesn‚Äôt have a TypeScript declaration and have a namespace called customLibrary in the global namespace. You can use this library in typescript code as below,

declare var customLibrary;
In the runtime, typescript will provide the type to the customLibrary variable as any type. The another alternative without using declare keyword is below

var customLibrary: any;

What are the differences between promises and observables
Some of the major difference in a tabular form

Promises	Observables
Emits only a single value at a time	Emits multiple values over a period of time(stream of values ranging from 0 to multiple)
Eager in nature; they are going to be called immediately	Lazy in nature; they require subscription to be invoked
Promise is always asynchronous even though it resolved immediately	Observable can be either synchronous or asynchronous
Doesn't provide any operators	Provides operators such as map, forEach, filter, reduce, retry, and retryWhen etc
Cannot be canceled	Canceled by using unsubscribe() method

What is heap
Heap(Or memory heap) is the memory location where objects are stored when we define variables. i.e, This is the place where all the memory allocations and de-allocation take place. Both heap and call-stack are two containers of JS runtime. Whenever runtime comes across variables and function declarations in the code it stores them in the Heap.

What is an event table
Event Table is a data structure that stores and keeps track of all the events which will be executed asynchronously like after some time interval or after the resolution of some API requests. i.e Whenever you call a setTimeout function or invoke async operation, it is added to the Event Table. It doesn't not execute functions on it‚Äôs own. The main purpose of the event table is to keep track of events and send them to the Event Queue as shown in the below diagram.

What is a microTask queue
Microtask Queue is the new queue where all the tasks initiated by promise objects get processed before the callback queue. The microtasks queue are processed before the next rendering and painting jobs. But if these microtasks are running for a long time then it leads to visual degradation.

What is the difference between shim and polyfill
A shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment, using only the means of that environment. It isn't necessarily restricted to a web application. For example, es5-shim.js is used to emulate ES5 features on older browsers (mainly pre IE9). Whereas polyfill is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively. In a simple sentence, a polyfill is a shim for a browser API.

How do you detect primitive or non primitive value type
In JavaScript, primitive types include boolean, string, number, BigInt, null, Symbol and undefined. Whereas non-primitive types include the Objects. But you can easily identify them with the below function,

var myPrimitive = 30;
var myNonPrimitive = {};
function isPrimitive(val) {
  return Object(val) !== val;
}

isPrimitive(myPrimitive);
isPrimitive(myNonPrimitive);
If the value is a primitive data type, the Object constructor creates a new wrapper object for the value. But If the value is a non-primitive data type (an object), the Object constructor will give the same object.

What is the difference between Function constructor and function declaration
The functions which are created with Function constructor do not create closures to their creation contexts but they are always created in the global scope. i.e, the function can access its own local variables and global scope variables only. Whereas function declarations can access outer function variables(closures) too.

Let's see this difference with an example,

Function Constructor:

var a = 100;
function createFunction() {
  var a = 200;
  return new Function("return a;");
}
console.log(createFunction()()); // 100
Function declaration:

var a = 100;
function createFunction() {
  var a = 200;
  return function func() {
    return a;
  };
}
console.log(createFunction()()); // 200

console.log(array.length); // 5

array.length = 2;
console.log(array.length); // 2
console.log(array); // [1,2]

What is an observable
An Observable is basically a function that can return a stream of values either synchronously or asynchronously to an observer over time. The consumer can get the value by calling subscribe() method. Let's look at a simple example of an Observable

import { Observable } from "rxjs";

const observable = new Observable((observer) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    observer.next("Message from a Observable!");
  }, 3000);
});

observable.subscribe((value) => console.log(value));

What is an async function
An async function is a function declared with the async keyword which enables asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style by avoiding promise chains. These functions can contain zero or more await expressions.

Let's take a below async function example,

async function logger() {
  let data = await fetch("http://someapi.com/users"); // pause until fetch returns
  console.log(data);
}
logger();
It is basically syntax sugar over ES2015 promises and generators.

How do you prevent promises swallowing errors
While using asynchronous code, JavaScript‚Äôs ES6 promises can make your life a lot easier without having callback pyramids and error handling on every second line. But Promises have some pitfalls and the biggest one is swallowing errors by default.

Let's say you expect to print an error to the console for all the below cases,

Promise.resolve("promised value").then(function () {
  throw new Error("error");
});

Promise.reject("error value").catch(function () {
  throw new Error("error");
});

new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  throw new Error("error");
});
But there are many modern JavaScript environments that won't print any errors. You can fix this problem in different ways,

Add catch block at the end of each chain: You can add catch block to the end of each of your promise chains

Promise.resolve("promised value")
  .then(function () {
    throw new Error("error");
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.error(error.stack);
  });
But it is quite difficult to type for each promise chain and verbose too.

Add done method: You can replace first solution's then and catch blocks with done method

Promise.resolve("promised value").done(function () {
  throw new Error("error");
});
Let's say you want to fetch data using HTTP and later perform processing on the resulting data asynchronously. You can write done block as below,

getDataFromHttp()
  .then(function (result) {
    return processDataAsync(result);
  })
  .done(function (processed) {
    displayData(processed);
  });
In future, if the processing library API changed to synchronous then you can remove done block as below,

getDataFromHttp().then(function (result) {
  return displayData(processDataAsync(result));
});
and then you forgot to add done block to then block leads to silent errors.

Extend ES6 Promises by Bluebird: Bluebird extends the ES6 Promises API to avoid the issue in the second solution. This library has a ‚Äúdefault‚Äù onRejection handler which will print all errors from rejected Promises to stderr. After installation, you can process unhandled rejections

Promise.onPossiblyUnhandledRejection(function (error) {
  throw error;
});
and discard a rejection, just handle it with an empty catch

Promise.reject("error value").catch(function () {});

How do you make an object iterable in javascript
By default, plain objects are not iterable. But you can make the object iterable by defining a Symbol.iterator property on it.

Let's demonstrate this with an example,

const collection = {
  one: 1,
  two: 2,
  three: 3,
  [Symbol.iterator]() {
    const values = Object.keys(this);
    let i = 0;
    return {
      next: () => {
        return {
          value: this[values[i++]],
          done: i > values.length,
        };
      },
    };
  },
};

const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator]();

console.log(iterator.next()); // ‚Üí {value: 1, done: false}
console.log(iterator.next()); // ‚Üí {value: 2, done: false}
console.log(iterator.next()); // ‚Üí {value: 3, done: false}
console.log(iterator.next()); // ‚Üí {value: undefined, done: true}
The above process can be simplified using a generator function,

const collection = {
  one: 1,
  two: 2,
  three: 3,
  [Symbol.iterator]: function* () {
    for (let key in this) {
      yield this[key];
    }
  },
};
const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator]();
console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 1, done: false}
console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 2, done: false}
console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 3, done: false}
console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: undefined, done: true}

What is a Proper Tail Call
First, we should know about tail call before talking about "Proper Tail Call". A tail call is a subroutine or function call performed as the final action of a calling function. Whereas Proper tail call(PTC) is a technique where the program or code will not create additional stack frames for a recursion when the function call is a tail call.

For example, the below classic or head recursion of factorial function relies on stack for each step. Each step need to be processed upto n * factorial(n - 1)

function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) {
    return 1;
  }
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
console.log(factorial(5)); //120
But if you use Tail recursion functions, they keep passing all the necessary data it needs down the recursion without relying on the stack.

function factorial(n, acc = 1) {
  if (n === 0) {
    return acc;
  }
  return factorial(n - 1, n * acc);
}
console.log(factorial(5)); //120
The above pattern returns the same output as the first one. But the accumulator keeps track of total as an argument without using stack memory on recursive calls.

How do you check an object is a promise or not
If you don't know if a value is a promise or not, wrapping the value as Promise.resolve(value) which returns a promise

function isPromise(object) {
  if (Promise && Promise.resolve) {
    return Promise.resolve(object) == object;
  } else {
    throw "Promise not supported in your environment";
  }
}

var i = 1;
var promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  resolve();
});

console.log(isPromise(i)); // false
console.log(isPromise(promise)); // true
Another way is to check for .then() handler type

function isPromise(value) {
  return Boolean(value && typeof value.then === "function");
}
var i = 1;
var promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  resolve();
});

console.log(isPromise(i)); // false
console.log(isPromise(promise)); // true

How to detect if a function is called as constructor
You can use new.target pseudo-property to detect whether a function was called as a constructor(using the new operator) or as a regular function call.

If a constructor or function invoked using the new operator, new.target returns a reference to the constructor or function.
For function calls, new.target is undefined.
function Myfunc() {
  if (new.target) {
    console.log("called with new");
  } else {
    console.log("not called with new");
  }

What are the different kinds of generators
There are five kinds of generators,

Generator function declaration:

function* myGenFunc() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}
const genObj = myGenFunc();
Generator function expressions:

const myGenFunc = function* () {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
};
const genObj = myGenFunc();
Generator method definitions in object literals:

const myObj = {
  *myGeneratorMethod() {
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
    yield 3;
  },
};
const genObj = myObj.myGeneratorMethod();
Generator method definitions in class:

class MyClass {
  *myGeneratorMethod() {
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
    yield 3;
  }
}
const myObject = new MyClass();
const genObj = myObject.myGeneratorMethod();
Generator as a computed property:

const SomeObj = {
  *[Symbol.iterator]() {
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
    yield 3;
  },
};

console.log(Array.from(SomeObj)); // [ 1, 2, 3 ]

What are the differences between for...of and for...in statements
Both for...in and for...of statements iterate over js data structures. The only difference is over what they iterate:

for..in iterates over all enumerable property keys of an object
for..of iterates over the values of an iterable object.
Let's explain this difference with an example,

let arr = ["a", "b", "c"];

arr.newProp = "newVlue";

// key are the property keys
for (let key in arr) {
  console.log(key); // 0, 1, 2 & newProp
}

// value are the property values
for (let value of arr) {
  console.log(value); // a, b, c
}
Since for..in loop iterates over the keys of the object, the first loop logs 0, 1, 2 and newProp while iterating over the array object. The for..of loop iterates over the values of a arr data structure and logs a, b, c in the console.

    this.age = age;
  }
}
But Static(class) and prototype data properties must be defined outside of the ClassBody declaration. Let's assign the age value for Person class as below,

Person.staticAge = 30;
Person.prototype.prototypeAge = 40;

How do you reverse an array without modifying original array?
The reverse() method reverses the order of the elements in an array but it mutates the original array. Let's take a simple example to demonistrate this case,

const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const newArray = originalArray.reverse();

console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
console.log(originalArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
There are few solutions that won't mutate the original array. Let's take a look.

Using slice and reverse methods: In this case, just invoke the slice() method on the array to create a shallow copy followed by reverse() method call on the copy.

const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const newArray = originalArray.slice().reverse(); //Slice an array gives a new copy

console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Using spread and reverse methods: In this case, let's use the spread syntax (...) to create a copy of the array followed by reverse() method call on the copy.

const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const newArray = [...originalArray].reverse();

console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Using reduce and spread methods: Here execute a reducer function on an array elements and append the accumulated array on right side using spread syntax

const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const newArray = originalArray.reduce((accumulator, value) => {
  return [value, ...accumulator];
}, []);

console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Using reduceRight and spread methods: Here execute a right reducer function(i.e. opposite direction of reduce method) on an array elements and append the accumulated array on left side using spread syntax

const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const newArray = originalArray.reduceRight((accumulator, value) => {
  return [...accumulator, value];
}, []);

console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Using reduceRight and push methods: Here execute a right reducer function(i.e. opposite direction of reduce method) on an array elements and push the iterated value to the accumulator

const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const newArray = originalArray.reduceRight((accumulator, value) => {
  accumulator.push(value);
  return accumulator;
}, []);

console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

What is global execution context?
The global execution context is the default or first execution context that is created by the JavaScript engine before any code is executed(i.e, when the file first loads in the browser). All the global code that is not inside a function or object will be executed inside this global execution context. Since JS engine is single threaded there will be only one global environment and there will be only one global execution context.

For example, the below code other than code inside any function or object is executed inside the global execution context.

var x = 10;

function A() {
  console.log("Start function A");

  function B() {
    console.log("In function B");
  }

  B();

What is debouncing?
Debouncing is a programming pattern that allows delaying execution of some piece of code until a specified time to avoid unnecessary CPU cycles and API calls. This in turn enhance the web page performance. The debounce function make sure that your code is only triggered once per user input. The common usecases are Search box suggestions, text-field auto-saves, and eliminating double-button clicks.

Let's say you want to show suggestions for a search query, but only after a visitor has finished typing it. So here you write a debounce function where the user keeps writing the characters with in 500ms then previous timer cleared out using clearTimeout and reschedule API call/DB query for a new time‚Äî300 ms in the future.

function debounce(func, timeout = 500) {
  let timer;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      func.apply(this, args);
    }, timeout);
  };
}
function fetchResults() {
  console.log("Fetching input suggestions");
}
const processChange = debounce(() => fetchResults());
The debounce() function can be used on input, button and window events.

Input:

<input type="text" onkeyup="processChange()" />
Button:

<button onclick="processChange()">Click me</button>
Windows event:

window.addEventListener("scroll", processChange);

What is throttling?
Throttling is a technique used to limit the execution of an event handler function in a given period of time, even when this event triggers continuously due to user actions. The common use cases are browser resizing, window scrolling, mouse movements etc.

The below example creates a throttle function to reduce the number of events for each pixel change and trigger scroll event for each 100ms except for the first event.

const throttle = (func, limit) => {
  let inThrottle;
  return (...args) => {
    if (!inThrottle) {
      func.apply(this, args);
      inThrottle = true;
      setTimeout(() => (inThrottle = false), limit);
    }
  };
};
window.addEventListener("scroll", () => {
  throttle(handleScrollAnimation, 100);
});

What is optional chaining?
According to MDN official docs, the optional chaining operator (?.) permits reading the value of a property located deep within a chain of connected objects without having to expressly validate that each reference in the chain is valid.

The ?. operator is like the . chaining operator, except that instead of causing an error if a reference is nullish (null or undefined), the expression short-circuits with a return value of undefined. When used with function calls, it returns undefined if the given function does not exist.

const adventurer = {
  name: "Alice",
  cat: {
    name: "Dinah",
  },
};

const dogName = adventurer.dog?.name;
console.log(dogName);
// expected output: undefined

console.log(adventurer.someNonExistentMethod?.());
// expected output: undefined

What is an environment record?
According to ECMAScript specification 262 (9.1):

Environment Record is a specification type used to define the association of Identifiers to specific variables and functions, based upon the lexical nesting structure of ECMAScript code.

Usually an Environment Record is associated with some specific syntactic structure of ECMAScript code such as a FunctionDeclaration, a BlockStatement, or a Catch clause of a TryStatement.

Each time such code is evaluated, a new Environment Record is created to record the identifier bindings that are created by that code.

How to verify if a variable is an array?
It is possible to check if a variable is an array instance using 3 different ways,

Array.isArray() method:

The Array.isArray(value) utility function is used to determine whether value is an array or not. This function returns a true boolean value if the variable is an array and a false value if it is not.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const user = { name: "John" };
Array.isArray(numbers); // true
Array.isArray(user); //false
instanceof operator:

The instanceof operator is used to check the type of an array at run time. It returns true if the type of a variable is an Array other false for other type.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const user = { name: "John" };
console.log(numbers instanceof Array); // true
console.log(user instanceof Array); // false
Checking constructor type:

The constructor property of the variable is used to determine whether the variable Array type or not.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const user = { name: "John" };
console.log(numbers.constructor === Array); // true
console.log(user.constructor === Array); // false

What is pass by value and pass by reference?
Pass-by-value creates a new space in memory and makes a copy of a value. Primitives such as string, number, boolean etc will actually create a new copy. Hence, updating one value doesn't impact the other value. i.e, The values are independent of each other.

let a = 5;
let b = a;

b++;
console.log(a, b); //5, 6
In the above code snippet, the value of a is assigned to b and the variable b has been incremented. Since there is a new space created for variable b, any update on this variable doesn't impact the variable a.

Pass by reference doesn't create a new space in memory but the new variable adopts a memory address of an initial variable. Non-primitives such as objects, arrays and functions gets the reference of the initiable variable. i.e, updating one value will impact the other variable.

let user1 = {
  name: "John",
  age: 27,
};
let user2 = user1;
user2.age = 30;

console.log(user1.age, user2.age); // 30, 30
In the above code snippet, updating the age property of one object will impact the other property due to the same reference.

How do you create your own bind method using either call or apply method?
The custom bind function needs to be created on Function prototype inorder to use it as other builtin functions. This custom function should return a function similar to original bind method and the implementation of inner function needs to use apply method call.

The function which is going to bind using custom myOwnBind method act as the attached function(boundTargetFunction) and argument as the object for apply method call.

Function.prototype.myOwnBind = function (whoIsCallingMe) {
  if (typeof this !== "function") {
    throw new Error(this + "cannot be bound as it's not callable");
  }
  const boundTargetFunction = this;
  return function () {
    boundTargetFunction.apply(whoIsCallingMe, arguments);

What is referential transparency?
An expression in javascript that can be replaced by its value without affecting the behaviour of the program is called referential transparency. Pure functions are referentially transparent.

const add = (x, y) => x + y;
const multiplyBy2 = (x) => x * 2;

//Now add (2, 3) can be replaced by 5.

multiplyBy2(add(2, 3));

What are the possible side-effects in javascript?
A side effect is the modification of the state through the invocation of a function or expression. These side effects make our function impure by default. Below are some side effects which make function impure,

Making an HTTP request. Asynchronous functions such as fetch and promise are impure.
DOM manipulations
Mutating the input data
Printing to a screen or console: For example, console.log() and alert()
Fetching the current time
Math.random() calls: Modifies the internal state of Math object

What is module pattern?
Module pattern is a designed pattern used to wrap a set of variables and functions together in a single scope returned as an object. JavaScript doesn't have access specifiers similar to other languages(Java, Python, etc) to provide private scope. It uses IIFE (Immediately invoked function expression) to allow for private scopes. i.e., a closure that protect variables and methods.

The module pattern looks like below,

(function () {
  // Private variables or functions goes here.

  return {
    // Return public variables or functions here.
  };
})();
Let's see an example of a module pattern for an employee with private and public access,

const createEmployee = (function () {
  // Private
  const name = "John";
  const department = "Sales";
  const getEmployeeName = () => name;
  const getDepartmentName = () => department;

  // Public
  return {
    name,
    department,
    getName: () => getEmployeeName(),
    getDepartment: () => getDepartmentName(),
  };
})();

console.log(createEmployee.name);
console.log(createEmployee.department);
console.log(createEmployee.getName());
console.log(createEmployee.getDepartment());
Note: It mimic the concepts of classes with private variables and methods.

What is Function Composition?
It is an approach where the result of one function is passed on to the next function, which is passed to another until the final function is executed for the final result.

var output1 = double(2);
var output2 = square(output1);
console.log(output2);

var output_final = square(double(2));

How to use await outside of async function prior to ES2022?
Prior to ES2022, if you attempted to use an await outside of an async function resulted in a SyntaxError.

await Promise.resolve(console.log("Hello await")); // SyntaxError: await is only valid in async function
But you can fix this issue with an alternative IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to get access to the feature.

(async function () {
  await Promise.resolve(console.log("Hello await")); // Hello await
})();
In ES2022, you can write top-level await without writing any hacks.

await Promise.resolve(console.log("Hello await")); //Hello await

What is the purpose of the this keyword in JavaScript?
The this keyword in JavaScript is a special variable that is used within a function to refer to the object on which the function is invoked. The value of this depends on how the function is called. It allows functions to access and interact with the object they are bound to.

The this keyword in JavaScript is a reference to the object that owns or invokes the current function. Its value is determined by the calling context.

Example 1: this in a Global Context

console.log(this);
In a global context, this refers to the global object (e.g., window in a browser).
Example 2: this in a Function

function displayThis() {
  console.log(this);
}

displayThis();
In a regular function, this refers to the global object.
Example 3: this in a Method

const person = {
  name: "John",
  greet: function () {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
  },
};

person.greet();
In a method, this refers to the object that owns the method (person in the case).
Example 4: this in an Event Handler

document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log(this);
});
In an event handler, this refers to the element that triggered the event (the button in this case).

What are the uses of closures?
Closures are a powerful feature in programming languages like JavaScript. They allow functions to retain access to variables from their containing (enclosing) scope even after the outer function has finished executing. This means that a function defined within another function can access variables from the outer function, even if the outer function has already returned. Here are some common use cases of closures:
Data Privacy: Closures can be used to create private variables and methods. By defining variables within a function's scope and returning inner functions that have access to those variables, you can create a form of encapsulation, limiting access to certain data or functionality.

Function Factories: Closures are often used to create functions with pre-set parameters. This is useful when you need to create multiple functions with similar behavior but different configurations.

Callback Functions: Closures are frequently used in asynchronous programming, such as handling event listeners or AJAX requests. The inner function captures variables from the outer scope and can access them when the callback is invoked.

Memoization: Closures can be used for memoization, a technique to optimize performance by caching the results of expensive function calls. The inner function can remember the results of previous calls and return the cached result if the same input is provided again.

iterators and Generators: Closures can be used to create iterators and generators, which are essential for working with collections of data in modern JavaScript.

What are the phases of execution context?
The execution context in JavaScript is a data structure that stores the information necessary for executing a piece of code. It includes the code itself, the values of the variables used in the code, and the scope chain. The scope chain is a list of objects that are used to resolve variable names.
The execution context has two phases:

Creation phase: In this phase, the JavaScript engine creates the execution context and sets up the script's environment. This includes creating the variable object and the scope chain.
Execution phase: In this phase, the JavaScript engine executes the code in the execution context. This includes evaluating expressions, assigning values to variables, and calling functions.
The execution context is created when a function is called. The function's code is then executed in the execution context. When the function returns, the execution context is destroyed.

What are the possible reasons for memory leaks?
Memory leaks can lead to poor performance, slow loading times and even crashes in web applications. Some of the common causes of memory leaks are listed below,

The execessive usage of global variables or omitting the var keyword in local scope.
Forgetting to clear the timers set up by setTimeout or setInterval.
Closures retain references to variables from their parent scope, which leads to variables might not garbage collected even they are no longer used.
What are the optimization techniques of V8 engine?
V8 engine uses the below optimization techniques.

Inline expansion: It is a compiler optimization by replacing the function calls with the corresponding function blocks.
Copy elision: This is a compiler optimization method to prevent expensive extra objects from being duplicated or copied.
Inline caching: It is a runtime optimization technique where it caches the execution of older tasks those can be lookup while executing the same task in the future.

How do you create polyfills for map, filter and reduce methods?
The polyfills for array methods such as map, filter and reduce methods can be created using array prototype.

map:

The built-in Array.map method syntax will be helpful to write polyfill. The map method takes the callback function as an argument and that callback function can have below three arguments passed into it.

i. Current value ii. Index of current value(optional) iii. array(optional)

The syntax would like below,

let newArray = arr.map(callback(currentValue[, index, arr) {
   // return new array after executing the code
})
Let's build our map polyfill based on the above syntax,

Array.prototype.myMap = function (cb) {
  let newArr = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    newArr.push(cb(this[i], i, this));
  }
  return newArr;
};

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const multiplyByTwo = nums.myMap((x) => x * 2);
console.log(multiplyByTwo); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
In the above code, custom method name 'myMap' has been used to avoid conflicts with built-in method.

filter: Similar to map method, Array.filter method takes callback function as an argument and the callback function can have three agurguments passed into it.

i. Current value
ii. Index of current value(optional)
iii. array(optional)
The syntax looks like below,

let newArray = arr.filter(callback(currentValue[, index, arr) {
  // return new array whose elements satisfy the callback conditions
})
Let's build our filter polyfill based on the above syntax,

Array.prototype.myFilter = function (cb) {
  let newArr = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    if (cb(this[i], i, this)) {
      newArr.push(this[i]);
    }
  }
  return newArr;
};

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const evenNums = nums.myFilter((x) => x % 2);
console.log(evenNums); // [2, 4, 6]
reduce:

  The built-in `Array.reduce` method syntax will be helpful to write our own polyfill. The reduce method takes the callback function as first argument and the initial value as second argument.

  The callback function can have four arguments passed into it.
  i. Accumulator
  ii. Current value
  iii. Index of current value(optional)
  iv. array(optional)

The syntax would like below,

```js
arr.reduce(callback((acc, curr, i, arr) => {}), initValue);
````

Let's build our reduce polyfill based on the above syntax,

```js
Array.prototype.myReduce = function (cb, initialValue) {
  let accumulator = initialValue;
  for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    accumulator = accumulator ? cb(accumulator, this[i], i, this) : this[i];
  }
  return accumulator;
};
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const sum = nums.myReduce((acc, curr, i, arr) => {
  return (acc += curr);
}, 0);
console.log(sum); // 21

What is the difference between map and forEach functions?
Both map and forEach functions are used to iterate over an arrays but there are some differences in their functionality.

1. **Returning values:** The `map` method returns a new array with transformed elements whereas `forEach` method returns `undefined` eventhough both of them are doing the same job.

```javascript
  const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  arr.map(x => x * x); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
  arr.forEach(x => x * x); //

  The `forEach()` method in JavaScript always returns undefined. This is because forEach() is used to iterate over arrays and perform side effects on each element, rather than returning a `new array or transforming the original array`
```

2. **Chaining methods:** The `map` method is chainable. i.e, It can be attached with `reduce`, `filter`, `sort` and other methods as well. Whereas `forEach` cannot be attached with any other methods because it returns `undefined` value.

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
arr.map((x) => x * x).reduce((total, cur) => total + cur); // 55
arr.forEach((x) => x * x).reduce((total, cur) => total + cur); //Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefine(reading 'reduce')
```

3. **Mutation:** The `map` method doesn't mutate the original array by returning new array. Whereas `forEach` method also doesn't mutate the original array but it's callback is allowed to mutate the original array.

**Note:** Both these methods existed since ES5 onwards.

What are the event phases of a browser?
There are 3 phases in the lifecycle of an event propagation in JavaScript,

Capturing phase: This phase goes down gradually from the top of the DOM tree to the target element when a nested element clicked. Before the click event reaching the final destination element, the click event of each parent's element must be triggered.

Target phase: This is the phase where the event originally occurred reached the target element .

Bubbling phase: This is reverse of the capturing phase. In this pase, the event bubbles up from the target element through it's parent element, an ancestor and goes all the way to the global window object.

The pictorial representation of these 3 event phases in DOM looks like below,

What are hidden classes?
Since JavaScript is a dynamic programming language, you can add or remove properties and methods from objects on the fly at runtime. This nature of JavaScript increases the dynamic dictionary lookups(because objects implemented as HashTables in memory) for retrieving a property on an object.

Let's consider the following example to see how the additional properties age and gender added at runtime.

function Person(name) {
this.name = name;
}

var person1 = new Person("John");
var person2 = new Person("Randy");

person1.age = 40;
person1.gender = "Male";

person2.gender = "Female";
person2.age = 50;
As a result, this behavior leads to lower JavaScript performance compared to the contiguous buffer method used in non-dynamic languages. The V8 engine provided a solution named hidden classes to optimize the access time when retrieving a property on an object. This optimization is achieved by sharing hidden classes among objects created in a similar fashion. These hidden classes are attached to each and every object to track its shape.

When V8 engine sees the constructor function(e.g, Person) is declared, it creates a hidden class (let's say Class01) without any offsets. Once the first property assignment statement (this.name = name) is executed, V8 engine will create a new hidden class (let's say Class02), inheriting all properties from the previous hidden class (Class01), and assign the property to offset 0. This process enables compiler to skip dictionary lookup when you try to retrieve the same property(i.e, name). Instead, V8 will directly point to Class02. The same procedure happens when you add new properties to the object.

For example, adding age and gender properties to Person constructor leads to transition of hidden classes(Class02 -> Class03 -> Class04). If you create a second object(Person2) based on the same Person object, both Class01 and Class02 hidden classes are going to be shared. However, the hidden classes Class03 and Class04 cannot be shared because second object has been modified with a different order of properties assignment.

Since both the objects(person1 and person2) do not share the hidden classes, now V8 engine cannot use Inline Caching technique for the faster access of properties.

‚¨Ü Back to Top

What is inline caching?
Inline caching is an optimization technique based on the observation that repeated calls to same function tends to occur on same type of objects. The V8 compiler stores a cache of the type of objects that were passed as a parameter in recent method calls. Upon next time when same function is called, compiler can directly search for the type in cache.

Let's consider an example where the compiler stores the shape type in cache for repeated calls in the loop.

let shape = { width: 30, height: 20 }; // Compiler store the type in cache as { width: <int>, height: <int>} after repeated calls

function area(obj) {
//Calculate area
}
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
area(shape);
}
After few successful calls of the same area method to its same hidden class, V8 engine omits the hidden class lookup and simply adds the offset of the property to the object pointer itself. As a result, it increases the execution speed.

There are mainly 3 types of inline caching possible:

Monomorphic: This is a optimized caching technique in which there can be always same type of objects passed.
Polymorphic: This ia slightly optimized caching technique in which limited number of different types of objects can be passed.
Megamorphic: It is an unoptimized caching in which any number of different objects can be passed.

What are the different ways to execute external scripts?
There are three different ways to execute external scripts,

async: The script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed as soon as it is available even before parsing completes. The parsing of the page is going to be interuppted once the script is downloaded completely and then the script is executed. Thereafter, the parsing of the remaining page will continue.

The syntax for async usage is as shown below,

<script src="demo.js" async></script>

defer: The script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed after the page has finished parsing.

The syntax for defer usage is as shown below,

<script src="demo.js" defer></script>

Neither async or defer: The script is downloaded and executed immediately by blocking parsing of the page until the script execution is completed.

Note: You should only use either async or defer attribute if the src attribute is present.

How to detect system dark mode in javascript?
The combination of Window.matchMedia() utility method along with media query is used to check if the user has selected a dark color scheme in their operating system settings or not. The CSS media query prefers-color-scheme needs to be passed to identify system color theme.

The following javascript code describes the usage,

const hasDarkColorScheme = () =>
window.matchMedia &&
window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches;
You can also watch changes to system color scheme using addEventListener,

window
.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)")
.addEventListener("change", (event) => {
const theme = event.matches ? "dark" : "light";
});
Note: The matchMedia method returns MediaQueryList object stores information from a media query.

What is the difference between substring and substr methods?
There are subtle differences between the substring() and substr() methods, so you should be careful not to get them confused.
The two parameters of substr() are start and length, while for substring(), they are start and end.
substr()'s start index will wrap to the end of the string if it is negative, while substring() will clamp it to 0.
Negative lengths in substr() are treated as zero, while substring() will swap the two indexes if end is less than start.
Furthermore, substr() is considered a legacy feature in ECMAScript, so it is best to avoid using it if possible.

const text = "Mozilla";
console.log(text.substring(2, 5)); // "zil"
console.log(text.substr(2, 3)); // "zil"

How to find the number of parameters expected by a function?
The function's object has a length property which tells you how many formal parameters expected by a function. This is a static value defined by the function, not the number of arguments the function is called with(arguments.length). The basic usage of length propery is,
function multiply(x, y) {
return x \* y;
}

function sum(a, b, c) {
return a + b + c;
}

console.log(multiply.length); //2
console.log(sum.length); //3
But there are few important rules which needs to be noted while using length property.

Default values: Only the parameters which exists before a default value are considered.

function sum(a, b = 2, c = 3) {
return a + b + c;
}
console.log(sum.length); // 1
Rest params: The rest parameters are excluded with in length property.

function sum(a, b, ...moreArgs) {
let total = a + b;
for (const arg of moreArgs) {
total += arg;
}
return total;
}
console.log(sum.length); // 2
Destructuring patterns: Each destructuring pattern counted as a single parameter.

function func([a, b], { x, y }) {
console.log(a + b, x, y);

What is globalThis, and what is the importance of it?
Nowadays JavaScript language is used in a wide variety of environments and each environment has its own object model. Due to this fact, there are different ways(syntax) to access the global object.

In web browser, the global object is accessible via window, self, or frames.
In Node environment, you have to use global.
In Web workers, the global object is available through self.
The globalThis property provides a standard way of accessing the global object without writing various code snippet to support multiple environments. For example, the global object retuned from multiple environments as shown below,

//1. browser environment
console.log(globalThis); // => Window {...}

//2. node.js environment
console.log(globalThis); // => Object [global] {...}

//3. web worker environment
console.log(globalThis); // => DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope {...}

What are the array mutation methods?
JavaScript array methods can be categorized into two groups:
Mutating methods: These are the methods that directly modify the original array.
Non-mutating methods: These methods return a new array without altering the original one.
There are 9 methods in total that mutate the arrays,

push: Adds one or more elements to the end of the array and returns the new length.
pop: Removes the last element from the array and returns that element.
unshift: Adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array and returns the new length..
shift: Removes the first element from the array and returns that element.
splice: Adds or removes elements from the array at a specific index position.
sort: Sorts the elements of the array in-place based on a given sorting criteria.
reverse: Reverses the order of elements in the given array.
fill: Fills all elements of the array with a specific value.
copyWithIn: Copies a sequence of elements within the array to a specified target index in the same array.

What is module scope in JavaScript?
Module scope is a feature introduced with ES6 (ES2015) modules that creates a scope specific to a module file, isolating variables and functions declared within it from the global scope and other modules. Variables and functions declared in a module are private by default and can only be accessed by other modules if they are explicitly exported.
Key characteristics of module scope:

Variables declared in a module are scoped to that module only.
Each module has its own top-level scope
Variables and functions need to be explicitly exported to be used in other modules
The global scope cannot access module variables unless they are explicitly exported and imported
Modules are always executed in strict mode
// moduleA.js

// This variable is PRIVATE to moduleA. It's like a tool inside a closed box.
const privateVariable = "I am private";

// This variable is PUBLIC because it's exported. Others can use it when they import moduleA.
export const publicVariable = "I am public";

// PUBLIC function because it's exported. But it can still access privateVariable inside moduleA.
export function publicFunction() {
console.log(privateVariable); // ‚úÖ This works because we're inside the same module.
return "Hello from publicFunction!";
}

// moduleB.js

// Importing PUBLIC items from moduleA.
import { publicVariable, publicFunction } from "./moduleA.js";

console.log(publicVariable); // ‚úÖ "I am public" - Works because it's exported.
console.log(publicFunction()); // ‚úÖ "Hello from publicFunction!" - Works as well.

// ‚ùå This will cause an ERROR because privateVariable was NOT exported from moduleA.
// console.log(privateVariable); // ‚ùå ReferenceError: privateVariable is not defined
Common use cases and benefits:

Encapsulation of module-specific code
Prevention of global scope pollution
Better code organization and maintenance
Explicit dependency management
Protection of private implementation details

What are shadowing and illegal shadowing?
Both shadowing and illegal shadowing refer to how variable names can "hide" or override others within nested scopes.

Shadowing occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope (like a function or block) has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. The inner variable shadows the outer one ‚Äî meaning, the inner variable takes precedence in its own scope.

Let's take an example where the inner a inside func() shadows the outer variable a.

let a = 10;

function func() {
let a = 20; // Shadows the outer 'a'
console.log(a); // 20
}

func();
console.log(a); // 10
Illegal shadowing in JavaScript refers to a syntax error that happens when you try to declare a block-scoped variable (let or const) with the same name as a variable declared using var in the same or an overlapping scope.

For example, if you declare both block-scoped variable and function scoped variable using the same name inside a function causes an illegal shadowing.

function test() {
var a = 10;
let a = 20; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared
}
As an another example, if you declare a variable with let or const in an outer scope, and then try to redeclare it with var inside a nested block, JavaScript throws an error ‚Äî even though var is supposed to be function-scoped. Since the var appears in a block, it ends up trying to overwrite the let in the outer scope, which causes a conflict.

let a = 10;
{
var a = 20; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared
console.log(a);
}

Why is it important to remove event listeners after use?
In JavaScript, you need to be mindful of removing event listeners to avoid memory leaks ‚Äî especially in long-lived apps like single-page applications (SPAs) or when working with frameworks/libraries. Eventhough JavaScript has automatic garbage collection, memory leaks can still happen if:

A DOM element is removed, but a listener still references it.
A callback (event listener) holds a reference to a large object or closure that can't be cleaned up.
Global objects like window, document etc retain listeners indefinitely unless manually removed.
So if you add any event listeners to DOM element, it is a good practice to remove it after its usage as shown below,

const button = document.getElementById("btn");

    function handleClick() {
      console.log("Clicked!");
    }

    button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);

    // Always remove when done
    button.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);

81. How do you verify two strings are anagrams or not?
    An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging all the letters of a different word or phrase exactly once. For example, the anagrams of "eat" word are "tea" and "ate".

You can split each word into characters, followed by sort action and later join them back. After that you can compare those two words to verify whether those two words are anagrams or not.

function verifyAnagrams(word1, word2) {
return word1.split("").sort().join("") === word2.split("").sort().join("");
}
console.log(verifyAnagrams("eat", "ate"));
